# GPU Lane — Playback & Export Roadmap + UX (plan of record)

Status: 2026-06-19. Lane A E0-E2 export, the scoped Lane A E3 GPU
replacement proof packet plus trusted/lossless throughput gates, P-pre GPU
AMaZE/processing parity, and Lane B P1-P3/P4 are now through their scoped proof
gates. P3/P4 are honest-scoped, not universal:
the RTX 4090 FastProxy proof validates the raw-fixes-enabled HQ Dual ISO
no-readback CUDA-to-GL R16 texture path with GL/backend/oracle parity;
unsupported states still fail closed to CPU readback or CPU presentation. The
remaining priority order is Lane A E4 rendered export, then Lane C portable GPU
backends. Future P4 default-promotion work requires a widened no-readback proof
scope, for example a non-Dual-ISO `GPU Tex NR` proof packet, before Auto may
sharpen beyond the current capability gate.

Update 2026-06-19: P-pre **processing parity** has progressed beyond the
original curve-first `allow_creative_adjustments` plan: creative slices 1-6 are
ported, and the later scoping pass records the creative family plus tractable
non-creative per-pixel stages as RTX 4090 validated (see §8.1-§8.2). Remaining
P-pre work is the explicitly scoped spatial/sequential stage decision path, not
the old Slice 1 contrast-curve start. Note also that Lane A **E1** is currently
realized as an off-by-default *shadow validator*
(`MLVAPP_GPU_EXPORT`): `llrawproc` runs the CUDA recon into a scratch buffer and
copies it over the CPU output only when byte-identical, so the CPU path stays
authoritative until the E2 parity gate promotes it.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 throughput gate: export now has a second, explicitly
opt-in measurement gate, `MLVAPP_GPU_EXPORT_TRUSTED=1`, exposed through
`-CandidateGpuExportTrusted` / `-RequireCandidateGpuExportTrusted` on the
release CDNG A/B and matrix wrappers and `-TrustedGpuExport` on the UltraMagnus
evidence wrapper. The default `MLVAPP_GPU_EXPORT` path remains the
CPU-authoritative shadow validator above. The trusted gate skips the CPU
Dual-ISO oracle for the candidate only after the already-scoped CUDA parity
shape is requested, writes GPU output into the final export buffer, and records
`gpu_export_trusted` / `gpu_export_trusted_frames` so throughput packets cannot
silently pass via the old shadow path. This is a profiling/proof surface, not a
default export behavior change. The first trusted UltraMagnus packet for commit
`2ba1c2e596fd1b8cda2a8add44d397f3792aafaf` passed on RTX 4090 with release
SHA256 `E99F592300AC8ACA00F3B238539711D3834DB1260228590A189A9532B00933A6`,
DNG hash PASS 96/96, and candidate trusted/attempted/replaced frames 96/96/96:
`.claude-state/profiling/ultramagnus-cdng-export/imported/packet-20260619T180606/summary.json`
with packet SHA256 `8B4A455CC4AB2434A9D4B7C37309C516A719183037A746F8D7E6283CF82FB971`.
It promotes the trusted measurement gate for the scoped Dual ISO shape, while
leaving default export CPU-authoritative. Throughput outcome: uncompressed
`M16-1327` improved from 5682.102 ms to 4602.206 ms average wall time
(-1079.896 ms, -15.705%), with average frame-total -31.004 ms/frame and
Dual-ISO -22.625 ms/frame. Lossless stayed byte-identical and used the trusted
GPU path, but overall wall time regressed from 6468.414 ms to 6775.267 ms
(+306.853 ms, +5.113%) despite average Dual-ISO -8.563 ms/frame, so the next E3
work is lossless/compression pipeline overlap rather than more shadow-validator
tuning.

Update 2026-06-18: Lane B **P1/P2** has an experimental readback bridge behind
`MLVAPP_GPU_PLAYBACK_RECON=1`. Playback render/recon threads opt in explicitly,
then `llrawproc` prepares only the CPU-side Dual-ISO match/LUT state and runs
`igpu_recon` to `IGPU_OUT_CPU16` in a temporary output buffer that is copied
back only after success; on missing DLL, unsupported config, invalid state, or
backend error it falls back to the existing CPU `diso_get_full20bit`.
The bridge is limited to the already-proven v1 recon shape
(`MEAN23 + alias_map ON + fullres ON + chroma OFF`) and is telemetry-only: it
does not add a GUI quality claim, no-readback present path, or adaptive mode.
Unlike export's CPU-authoritative shadow replacement, playback P2 deliberately
trusts a successful backend `rc==0` and does not run a per-frame CPU memcmp;
that trust boundary is accepted only for this experimental, env-gated bridge
after the 4090 parity pass, with any future shadow-verify mode tracked as a
canary/follow-up rather than the normal playback path.

Update 2026-06-18 P3 surface: `MLVAPP_EXPERIMENTAL_GPU_PLAYBACK_RECON_TEXTURE_PRESENT=1`
is now an explicit request surface. In the narrow experimental x1 GPU preview
processing + `Decode/Reconstruct/Process` playback shape, the Qt GL viewport can
present the P2 reconstructed Bayer frame through a `GL_R16`/Bayer16 texture and
shader-side bilinear debayer/display processing. Telemetry labels this as
`source=cpu16_readback_reconstructed_bayer` and records
`gpu_playback_recon_texture_present_no_readback_active=false`; it is a presenter
surface, not the final P3 win. Activating true P3 still requires a GUI-thread-safe
CUDA `IGPU_OUT_GL_TEXTURE` producer (or final RGB CUDA-to-GL backend) so the
recon output reaches the display without the CPU16 readback.

Update 2026-06-18 P4 status/telemetry slice: the existing Playback Quality
UI/status surface now classifies the presented pipeline as `CPU`, `GPU Preview`,
`GPU RB`, `GPU Tex RB`, or `GPU Tex NR`. Playback smoke logs emit matching
machine-readable tokens (`cpu`, `gpu_preview`, `gpu_recon_readback`,
`gpu_texture_readback`, `gpu_texture_no_readback`) on per-frame GPU telemetry
and a session summary. The 2026-06-19 scoped P3 producer may report `GPU Tex NR`
/ `gpu_texture_no_readback` only when the validated CUDA-to-GL no-readback path
actually presents the frame; readback or unsupported fallback remains reported
as `GPU Tex RB`, `GPU RB`, or `CPU`.

Update 2026-06-19 P3 proof: `MLVAPP_EXPERIMENTAL_GPU_PLAYBACK_RECON_TEXTURE_PRESENT=1`
can now present the proven raw-fixes-enabled HQ Dual ISO shape through
`source=cuda_gl_r16_texture` with
`gpu_playback_recon_texture_present_no_readback_active=true`. The accepted
UltraMagnus RTX 4090 run (`20260619T002209`, release executable SHA256
`F70CE56F8418E4107D1AF502F31A3B94399E92253016EC4950E145AB59922CAE`) reported
`correctnessValidated=true`, `gpu_texture_no_readback_frames=94`,
`glParityMatchCount=10`, `glMismatchTotal=0`, and advancing GL texture hashes.
The raw-fixes-off control receipt remains non-proof by design and must not arm
no-readback.
`tools/profiling/invoke-ultramagnus-p3-evidence.ps1` now treats the backend DLL
as part of that proof surface: before validation, the UltraMagnus agent builds
`tools/gpu/backend/igpu_recon_cuda.dll`, verifies it through `dll_test.exe`, and
deploys the DLL plus CUDA runtime beside the staged release executable. Use
`-SkipBackendBuild` only when deliberately reusing an already-current deployed
backend; a staged release tree without `igpu_recon_cuda.dll` is expected to fall
back before GL no-readback proof can occur.

head `1010ed4542f5cabbd8cc30165b1fa80f2fc15dad` on branch

`glScreenshotMethod=app_internal_gl_viewport_grab`. VM-local playback remains
tooling/fallback smoke only; P3 no-readback proof is UltraMagnus-backed.

Update 2026-06-19 P4 default slice: clean playback settings now default to
`Auto` instead of `Fast`, matching the user-facing mode plan below while still
round-tripping explicit `Fast` selections. This is only the first adaptive
quality polish step. The Auto sampler also keeps headroom-based sharpening at
HQ x4 until the caller has observed a validated no-readback presentation path;
capability-aware promotion/demotion remains scoped by the P3 proof gate and
must keep unsupported states on readback/CPU paths. Paired GUI-smoke A/B review
now has a durable comparator (`tools/profiling/compare-release-gui-smoke-ab.ps1`)
that reports screenshot pixel deltas, GUI/presented/timeline FPS deltas, and an
optional screenshot-drift failure verdict from two `run-release-gui-smoke.ps1`
JSON outputs. The comparator also carries `visualQuality.autoDecision` deltas,
including Auto reason, target/budget/average cadence in milliseconds and
FPS-equivalent form, sample count, capability latches, and capability-failure
arrays. This is a tooling-only review path over existing smoke JSON; it does
not create a local VM playback proof, and P3/P4 no-readback promotion evidence
still has to come from the UltraMagnus proof path.
The Auto tooltip and playback smoke summary now report both milliseconds and
FPS-equivalent cadence for the latest Auto decision (`auto_avg_fps_equivalent`
and `auto_budget_fps_equivalent`), so adaptive decisions can be read without
manual conversion.
The visible playback quality menu/status now uses the roadmap vocabulary:
`Auto`, `Prioritize Quality`, and `Prioritize Smoothness`. The underlying mode
ids and legacy `fast`/`hq` automation names remain supported; the parser also
accepts `prioritize-smoothness` and `prioritize_quality`.
The GUI smoke wrapper now defaults its validation gate to deterministic Auto
mode (`quality_mode=2`) and x4 scale request by forcing those env selectors,
so persisted GUI settings cannot create stale false failures. Smokes that
intentionally exercise saved GUI state can pass `-UsePersistedPlaybackSettings`,
and explicit forced-mode probes can still pass `-QualityMode`, `-ScaleFactor`,
and `-Expected*` overrides.
The wrapper now also lifts the Auto cadence/capability fields from
`playback_smoke.summary` into `visualQuality.autoDecision` and fails the default
Auto gate if those fields are missing. That keeps P4 smoke artifacts
self-contained: reviewers can see target FPS, last Auto reason, ms and
FPS-equivalent cadence, sample count, headroom capability, and validated
no-readback latch/demotion state without hand-parsing raw log lines.
The P4 proof wrapper now also derives boolean Auto capability fields and fails
default Auto smokes when the capability summary is internally inconsistent:
`headroom_non_dual_iso_sharper_hq` must carry an active validated no-readback
capability latch, `auto_headroom_capability_last` cannot be true while
`auto_validated_no_readback_capability_observed` is false, and observed/demoted
cannot both be true in the same summary. The derived
`visualQuality.autoDecision.capabilityConsistent` and
`validation.autoDecisionCapabilityConsistent` fields make this fail-closed gate
reviewable without widening the scoped P3 no-readback claim.
The same wrapper now fails default GUI smokes when `presented_frames` is missing
or zero; `-AllowZeroPresentedFrames` is reserved for deliberate launch-only
probes. This closes a proof gap where a smoke could previously report
`validation.ok=true` with Auto telemetry present but no rendered/presented frame
sample.
The visible status tooltip now defines the full P4 pipeline vocabulary,
including `GPU Preview`, and
`GuiSmoke.mainWindowGpuPreviewPolicyClassifiesPlaybackPipelineStatus` pins its
token, label, and description so the UI text cannot silently drift from the
telemetry enum.

Update 2026-06-19 P4 Look Assist safety slice: the profile/playback harness now
has an explicit `--exercise-look-assist-settle` path plus metadata for settled
diagnostics and safety fallback state. Floor-lifted Look Assist now fails closed
when the post-applied processed-color oracle is invalid under an original-raw-
white, auto-chroma-smoothed state, covering the `M16-1243` control without
over-falling back on the flatter `M16-1446` night clip. Rebuilt console guards
cover the standard M16 Look Assist set plus the optional 1243 control:
`ClipGolden.LocalM16LookAssistRejectsExtremeGreenAutoWbWhenAvailable`,
`ClipGolden.LocalM16LookAssistRejectsBrightNeutralGreenClampWhenAvailable`, and
`ClipGolden.LocalM16LookAssistCapsOnlyFlatNoiseFloorNightWhenAvailable`.
Headless release-tree profile evidence is under
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-p4-lookassist-headless-final/`: `M16-1327`
and `M16-1243` fall back, while `M16-1347` and `M16-1446` remain enabled. This
is local VM build/profile proof only; CUDA/GL, no-readback, and UltraMagnus RTX
4090 claims remain governed by the UltraMagnus proof gate.

Update 2026-06-19 P4 capability-telemetry slice: Auto sampler decisions now
carry the exact `sharperHeadroomScaleAllowed` gate that decides whether
headroom may promote a non-Dual-ISO clip from `HQ x4` to `HQ x2`. The status
tooltip, playback-profile frame JSON, and playback smoke summary expose this as
`auto_headroom_capability_last`, so reviewers can tell whether Auto sharpened
because the scoped true no-readback texture path was actually observed or held
back for lack of capability proof. This is evidence/control polish only; it
does not widen the P3 no-readback scope.
The follow-on P4 control slice latches a session-scoped
`auto_validated_no_readback_capability_observed` flag only after an accepted
presented frame reports the validated `GPU Tex NR` pipeline. Auto headroom
promotion now uses that latched capability rather than the current frame alone,
so a real no-readback proof can inform later Auto decisions in the same session
without treating mere FPS headroom or GPU presence as proof.
If a later frame is still a no-readback candidate but falls back before
presenting `GPU Tex NR`, the latch is cleared and
`auto_validated_no_readback_capability_demoted_last` reports the demotion. That
keeps Auto's capability-aware promotion/demotion tied to actual presentation
truth instead of stale optimism.
The latch is playback-run scoped: clip opens, play stop/start, quality-mode,
preview-mode, preview-resolution, scale override, Dual ISO/raw-fix context, and
Auto target-FPS changes all reset it, so a later context must present
`GPU Tex NR` again before Auto uses no-readback capability to sharpen quality
decisions. The headroom permission is stricter than the general visible latch:
a Dual ISO `GPU Tex NR` observation may keep
`auto_validated_no_readback_capability_observed=true` for telemetry, but it does
not arm non-Dual-ISO `HQ x2` promotion; that promotion requires a non-Dual-ISO
no-readback observation in the current run.
The same reset path now also reseeds the active Auto scale/HQ decision to the
current mode's initial state, and clip open reseeds after the new object becomes
current, so stale x2/headroom or Fast-demotion decisions cannot leak into a new
run before the sampler and capability gate observe that context.
The default/fallback path now uses the same configured `Auto` default for
missing, invalid, corrupt, or unavailable hidden Phase3 quality settings instead
of silently falling back to legacy `Fast`, with console coverage in
`PlaybackQualitySettings.RoundTripQualityMode`.
The adjacent preview-mode override parser now accepts the same natural
case-insensitive forms for `MLVAPP_PLAYBACK_AGGRESSIVE_PREVIEW` and
`MLVAPP_PLAYBACK_PREVIEW_MODE` (`Aggressive`, `AGGRESSIVE-PERFORMANCE`,
`Sharp-Smooth`, `ON`, `Off`, etc.) while preserving the existing
`MLVAPP_PLAYBACK_AGGRESSIVE_PREVIEW` precedence and invalid-value fallback, with
console coverage in `PlaybackPreviewModeOverride.ParsesCaseInsensitiveEnvNames`.
The advanced preview-mode and preview-resolution persisted controls now also
have QSettings default/round-trip/invalid-value guards in
`PlaybackQualitySettings.RoundTripPreviewMode`,
`PlaybackQualitySettings.RoundTripPreviewResolution`, and
`PlaybackQualitySettings.PreviewResolutionProxyLevelMapping`; the shared
settings cleanup helper clears those keys so P4 control-surface tests do not
inherit stale GUI state from earlier local runs.
This is the current scoped P4 closeout: Auto may only promote quality from
observed presentation truth, and under the accepted P3 proof scope the app must
not default-promote non-Dual-ISO headroom to `HQ x2` until a matching
non-Dual-ISO no-readback proof packet exists.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 prep: the export-stage profiler now records
`queue_idle_ms` as a supported stage. The first frame has no prior handoff gap,
while later frames measure the elapsed time between the previous profiled frame
finishing and the next `saveDngFrame` call beginning. This keeps current serial
exports byte-inert while giving future pipelined export experiments a scheduler
starvation/overlap signal before CPU decode workers, the single GPU recon queue,
or CPU compress/write workers are promoted. Async-writer experiments now also
record `producer_frame_ms`, the caller-side time from frame-save entry until the
serial path finishes or the async path enqueues the immutable payload, plus
`producer_queue_idle_ms`, the gap between the previous caller-side return and
the next frame-save entry. The older `queue_idle_ms` remains previous profiled
frame completion to next frame-save entry, which means async profiles can show
writer-thread completion lag there even after the producer has returned.
`writer_completion_lag_ms` is derived as `frame_total_ms - producer_frame_ms`,
making that post-producer writer lag explicit in release-tree profiles. Real
release-tree baseline and candidate runs should use
`tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile.ps1`, which launches the
current `MLVApp.exe --batch` CDNG export path with
`MLVAPP_EXPORT_STAGE_PROFILER=1` and writes the profile JSON next to the exported
DNG output bundle. The runner can pass a bounded `-MaxFrames` cap through to
batch `--max-frames`, so real-footage probes can avoid unbounded DNG output
before full benchmark matrices are intentional. Headless batch export now also
accepts `--cdng-codec uncompressed|lossless|fast-pass`, and the profiling
wrappers expose that as `-CdngCodec` / per-case `cdngCodec`, so E3 can run a
representative lossless-DNG writer-heavy matrix without changing the default
uncompressed batch path. `tools/profiling/compare-export-stage-profiles.ps1` now
summarizes frame-total avg/p95 deltas plus queue-idle avg/p95 deltas in stdout,
and `-FailOnRegression` gates both avg and p95 frame-total regressions.
`tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile-matrix.ps1` wraps the paired
A/B runner across named cases and repeats, writing a single
`matrix-summary.json` with per-run frame-total, producer-frame, queue-idle,
writer-completion-lag, payload handoff (`payload_clone_ms`), writer-queue-wait, wrapper wall-clock
elapsed-time deltas, async queue capacity, and async max-queued fields. Tiny
fixture matrix runs are smoke tests only; E3 promotion still requires a bounded
real-footage matrix with receipts/frame caps that match the export scenario
under review. `tools/profiling/compare-cdng-dng-output-hashes.ps1` now turns
the baseline-vs-candidate DNG SHA256 sweep into a reusable companion for both
matrix summaries and standalone A/B summaries: it follows each run's A/B
`summary.json` in matrix mode or reads a single A/B `summary.json` with
`-AbSummary`/`-SummaryJson`, compares DNG files by relative path, length, and
SHA256, writes `dng-hash-comparison.json`, and fails closed under
`-FailOnMismatch`. Validation reran matrix mode against
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-matrix-16x3-current/matrix-summary.json`
for 144/144 matched pairs, and the deliberate mismatch smoke under
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-hash-tool-negative-smoke/` exited 1.
A/B and matrix summaries now also label the comparison as
`feature-ab` or `identity-aa`, so baseline-vs-baseline calibration runs cannot
be mistaken for feature promotion or regression evidence. The A/B runner also
supports explicit `BaselineFirst` or `CandidateFirst` execution, and the matrix
runner can alternate run order across repeats with `-AlternateRunOrder`, so
future promotion packets can reduce warm-cache/order bias without changing the
baseline/candidate output locations or comparator contract.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 payload contract: `dngFramePayload_t`,
`buildDngFramePayload`, `writeDngFramePayload`, `saveDngFrameViaPayload`, and
`freeDngFramePayload` now provide an immutable header+image handoff for a built
DNG frame. The default GUI/batch export path remains serial through
`saveDngFrame`, but setting `MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_PAYLOAD_HANDOFF=1` or passing
`-UsePayloadHandoff` to `tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile.ps1`
routes CDNG export through a serial build-payload/write-payload boundary. The
same payload contract now also has an opt-in writer-worker path behind
`MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_ASYNC_WRITER=1` / `-UseAsyncWriter`; it defaults to one
worker and one in-flight payload so current behavior remains bounded, but
`MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_ASYNC_WRITER_QUEUE_DEPTH` / `-AsyncWriterQueueDepth` can
raise that bounded depth and `MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_ASYNC_WRITER_THREADS` /
`-AsyncWriterThreadCount` can raise the worker count for release-tree
experiments. Multi-worker runs may complete files out of frame order and remain
experimental until byte identity plus scheduler benefit are proven. The profiler JSON
records `payload_handoff_env_enabled`, `async_writer_env_enabled`,
`async_writer_thread_count`, `async_writer_queue_capacity`, and
`async_writer_max_queued`, and the pipeline
test suite verifies byte-for-byte parity for uncompressed and compressed tiny
Dual-ISO DNG exports, including the async writer path. `tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile-ab.ps1` runs
paired release-tree baseline/candidate exports and writes both profiles plus
`compare.json`/`summary.json`, so E3 experiments have one repeatable promotion
packet. Payload-handoff profiles now expose `payload_clone_ms`, the historical
field name for the small header copy plus large image-buffer ownership
handoff/replacement cost, and async writer profiles expose
`writer_queue_wait_ms`, which separates bounded writer-queue backpressure from
real `disk_write_ms`. Paired A/B summaries include producer-frame and
producer-queue-idle deltas plus writer-completion-lag deltas so larger
decode/GPU/write scheduler work is not promoted on a blended completion signal.
This is scheduler prep, not a throughput claim.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 matrix finding: the first bounded real-footage
matrix with wrapper elapsed timing is
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-real-matrix-elapsed/matrix-summary.json`.
It used `C:\temp\MLV\M16-1210.MLV`, `M16-1327.MLV`, and `M16-1347.MLV` with
`C:\temp\MLV\master.marxml`, `maxFrames=8`, `repeats=2`, payload handoff,
async writer, queue depth 2, and frame-total regression gates enabled. Verdict:
FAIL, with 4/6 runs passing and 2/6 failing. Overall wrapper elapsed delta
averaged -118.551 ms, but `m16-1210-master` averaged +160.28 ms, and the matrix
still recorded frame-total avg/p95 gate failures on `m16-1210-master` repeat 1
and `m16-1327-master` repeat 1. The async writer therefore remains
non-promoted: queue wait stayed 0.0 ms, async max queued stayed 1, average
writer-completion lag was 3.379 ms, and average payload handoff cost was
2.089 ms. Next E3 work should either reduce/avoid the payload copy or run a
serial payload-only matrix to separate payload overhead from writer-thread
overlap before any broader scheduler rewrite.

Follow-up payload-only matrix:
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-payload-only-matrix/matrix-summary.json`
used the same three clips, receipt, `maxFrames=8`, and `repeats=2`, but enabled
only `-CandidateUsePayloadHandoff` without async writer. Verdict: FAIL, with
4/6 runs passing and 2/6 failing. Overall wrapper elapsed delta averaged
-38.813 ms, but `m16-1210-master` averaged +204.40 ms and still produced one
avg/p95 frame-total gate failure; `m16-1327-master` produced one p95-only gate
failure despite elapsed improvement. Writer-completion lag was effectively zero
(0.000208 ms average), while payload handoff cost averaged 2.143 ms. This
pointed the next E3 implementation step at avoiding the extra large image
payload copy, while retaining the small header copy, instead of widening async
writer concurrency.

Image-buffer handoff follow-up:
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-payload-move-final-two-frame/profile.json`
proved the real compressed-input/uncompressed-output two-frame crash repro clean
on committed build `c5d92baf` after the payload boundary was narrowed to a small
header copy plus large image-buffer ownership move. The profile wrote two
`M16-1210` DNGs at 8,202,254 bytes each and reported `payload_clone_ms`
averaging 0.0147 ms. The committed-build bounded real-footage payload-only
matrix
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-payload-move-payload-only-matrix-final/matrix-summary.json`
then completed without crashes on the same three clips, receipt, `maxFrames=8`,
and `repeats=2`; all 6/6 runs passed, all six baseline/candidate run outputs
matched with zero DNG SHA256 mismatches, payload handoff cost averaged
0.01515 ms, wrapper elapsed averaged -182.774 ms, and frame-total average delta
averaged -11.402 ms. This promotes the serial payload handoff as the bounded E3
candidate slice, while preserving the scope boundary: it is still a 3-clip,
8-frame, 2-repeat release-tree matrix with one receipt set, not a broad export
benchmark. The matching committed-build async-writer matrix
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-payload-move-async-matrix-final/matrix-summary.json`
also completed with zero DNG SHA256 mismatches and 0.01469 ms average payload
handoff cost, but remained non-promoted at 3/6 PASS and 3/6 FAIL. Queue wait
stayed 0.0 ms, async max queued stayed 1, and writer-completion lag averaged
3.291 ms. Next E3 work should keep serial payload handoff gated for broader
promotion proof, and investigate why the async path never exceeds one queued
payload and does not convert writer lag into stable frame-total gains before any
async scheduler rewrite is promoted.

Broader serial-payload promotion-gate follow-up:
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-payload-promotion-matrix/matrix-summary.json`
reran the committed serial payload handoff on the same three clips and receipt
with `maxFrames=24` and `repeats=3`. The matrix completed byte-correctly: all
nine baseline/candidate DNG output sets matched with zero SHA256 mismatches, the
average payload handoff cost stayed at 0.015337 ms, wrapper elapsed averaged
-120.410 ms, writer-completion lag averaged 0.000141 ms, and writer queue wait
stayed 0.0 ms. Verdict: FAIL, with 7/9 runs passing and two narrow timing-gate
misses: `m16-1210-master` repeat 3 tripped the frame-total p95 gate by 10.371%
despite -269.677 ms elapsed improvement, and `m16-1327-master` repeat 3 tripped
the frame-total average gate by 5.402% despite -107.357 ms elapsed improvement.
This keeps the serial payload handoff as a correct, low-cost E3 candidate, but
does not promote it beyond the earlier bounded 8-frame gate. Next E3 work should
calibrate the promotion gate with an A/A timing-variance matrix or equivalent
methodology proof before treating marginal 24-frame frame-total deltas as a
feature blocker or broad promotion signal.

A/A gate-calibration follow-up:
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-aa-promotion-matrix/matrix-summary.json`
reran the same 24-frame, 3-repeat, 3-clip matrix with identical serial export
settings on both sides (`comparisonMode=identity-aa`, no payload handoff, no
async writer). The outputs again matched with zero DNG SHA256 mismatches, but
the strict 5% average / 10% p95 frame-total gates still reported Verdict: FAIL,
with 5/9 runs passing and 4/9 runs failing. Overall elapsed averaged -82.335 ms,
frame-total average delta averaged +0.897 ms, frame-total p95 delta averaged
+8.060 ms, writer-completion lag averaged 0.000070 ms, and writer queue wait
stayed 0.0 ms. The identity failures were
`m16-1210-master` repeat 1 p95 +10.952%,
`m16-1327-master` repeat 1 p95 +15.254%,
`m16-1347-master` repeat 1 average +5.827%, and
`m16-1347-master` repeat 2 average +8.389% plus p95 +13.915%. This confirms the
24-frame gate is currently a timing-variance detector, not a reliable standalone
promotion/blocker oracle for the serial payload handoff. Future E3 promotion
should either use a variance-adjusted criterion, longer/stratified samples, or
an explicit A/A companion threshold before broadening the serial payload handoff
claim.

A/A-envelope serial-payload rerun:
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-payload-aa-calibrated-matrix/matrix-summary.json`
then reran the feature comparison with rounded companion thresholds from the
identity matrix (`maxFrameTotalRegressionPercent=8.5`,
`maxFrameTotalP95RegressionPercent=15.5`). The comparison metadata correctly
reported `comparisonMode=feature-ab`, all nine DNG output sets again matched
with zero SHA256 mismatches, average payload handoff cost was 0.015769 ms,
wrapper elapsed averaged -110.241 ms, frame-total average delta averaged
-0.639 ms, frame-total p95 delta averaged -0.886 ms, writer-completion lag
averaged 0.000178 ms, and writer queue wait stayed 0.0 ms. Verdict still
remained FAIL at 7/9 PASS and 2/9 FAIL: `m16-1210-master` repeat 1 exceeded the
p95 companion gate at +22.514%, and `m16-1347-master` repeat 2 exceeded both
average (+9.638%) and p95 (+20.599%) companion gates. This does not point back
to payload-copy cost; it shows the current short real-footage matrix is still
order/noise sensitive enough that broad serial-payload promotion should remain
held at the earlier bounded 8-frame claim until E3 has a stronger methodology
such as longer samples, randomized ordering, or paired A/A-per-feature runs.

Alternating-order methodology follow-up:
`tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile-ab.ps1` and
`tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile-matrix.ps1` now record
`runOrder` and can alternate baseline/candidate execution across matrix repeats.
The committed-tooling A/A alternating matrix
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-aa-alternating-matrix/matrix-summary.json`
reported `comparisonMode=identity-aa`, `alternateRunOrder=true`, zero DNG
SHA256 mismatches, and Verdict: FAIL at 5/9 PASS and 4/9 FAIL. Aggregate elapsed
delta averaged +58.827 ms, frame-total average delta averaged -0.033 ms, and
frame-total p95 delta averaged +7.724 ms; strict-gate failures still reached
avg +10.638%, p95 +11.543%, avg +10.308% plus p95 +14.586%, and avg +7.841%
plus p95 +48.743%. The matching serial-payload alternating matrix
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-payload-alternating-matrix/matrix-summary.json`
reported `comparisonMode=feature-ab`, `alternateRunOrder=true`, zero DNG SHA256
mismatches, and Verdict: FAIL at 7/9 PASS and 2/9 FAIL. Aggregate elapsed
averaged -64.279 ms, frame-total average delta averaged -1.700 ms, frame-total
p95 delta averaged -0.284 ms, and payload handoff averaged 0.016170 ms, but two
candidate-first repeats still exceeded the p95 gate (+14.454% and +18.477%).
This reinforces the current E3 status: serial payload handoff is correct and
low-cost, but broad promotion still needs longer/stratified sampling or a
statistical matrix comparator; alternating order alone is a useful control, not
a sufficient promotion oracle.
That comparator now exists as
`tools/profiling/compare-cdng-export-matrices.ps1`. The first calibration packet
at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-payload-alternating-calibration/calibration.json`
compared the alternating identity matrix against the alternating serial-payload
matrix and reported `verdict=WITHIN_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE` while preserving
`identityRawGateUnstable=true`. Frame-total average stayed inside the identity
positive envelope (identity max +12.456658 ms, feature max +6.042370 ms), and
frame-total p95 also stayed inside it (identity max +64.821900 ms, feature max
+27.284600 ms). Payload handoff and tiny writer-lag deltas are expected feature
costs, not frame-envelope regressions. This is enough to say the serial payload
handoff's 24-frame alternating evidence is not worse than measured A/A jitter,
but the roadmap still does not promote it as a broad export-throughput win until
the sampling strategy itself is stronger.
The comparator now writes
`release-cdng-export-matrix-calibration.v4`, fails closed on non-identity
calibration inputs, non-feature candidate inputs, alternate-run-order mismatch,
or case/repeat/run-order key mismatch, and includes per-case envelopes plus
median/p95/positive-max summaries and stage-attribution metrics from each
run's `compare.json`. Its `stageAttribution` object also names the dominant
positive feature-average stage and the dominant positive-max identity-envelope
excess stage, so E3 promotion/blocker packets can cite the leading stage driver
without hand-parsing the metrics array. Its `schedulerAttribution` block also
separates producer-frame / producer-idle deltas from writer-completion-lag /
writer-queue-wait deltas, including p95 metrics, so async evidence can
distinguish caller-side overlap from completion backlog. Validation against the
same alternating A/A and serial-payload matrices produced
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-payload-alternating-calibration-v4/calibration.json`
with `verdict=WITHIN_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE`, `compatible_keys=True`, `modes_ok=True`,
and `dominant_scheduler_stage=producerQueueIdleAvgDeltaMs`; the v4
identity-as-feature negative smoke at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-calibration-negative-smoke-v4/identity-as-feature.json`
exited 1 as `INCOMPATIBLE_MATRICES`. This upgrades the E3 methodology guardrail:
future promotion packets must compare matching identity and feature matrices
before a noisy raw gate is interpreted as either a blocker or a throughput win.

Async-writer queue-depth investigation:
the current real-footage matrices exercise the batch CDNG receipt/default path,
where producer-frame work is dominated by decode/recon/pack at roughly
hundred-millisecond scale while `disk_write_ms` is only a few milliseconds. The
single writer worker therefore drains each payload before the next payload is
usually ready, so `async_writer_max_queued=1` is expected even when the configured
queue capacity is 2. That makes the async writer non-promotable for this
workload, but it is not by itself a queue-capacity bug. Next async E3 proof
should use a deliberately writer-heavy/compressed-output scenario or a targeted
stress harness before changing scheduler policy; the current matrices mainly
show that serial payload handoff is cheap and that write overlap is not the
bottleneck for the measured default path.

Targeted async-writer stress control:
`MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_ASYNC_WRITER_DEBUG_DELAY_MS` and
`-AsyncWriterDebugDelayMs` now provide a test/profiling-only writer-thread delay
that is inert unless explicitly opted in. The pipeline regression
`DualIsoPipeline.DngFrameAsyncWriterDebugDelayCanFillConfiguredQueue` verifies
that a queue depth of 2 can report `async_writer_max_queued=2`, and the
release-tree smoke packet at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-async-delay-release-smoke-18118e78/profile.json`
exported two `M16-1210` frames on build
`18118e7893f43174ffc275020a53c27c0e1fbc87` with
`async_writer_queue_capacity=2`,
`async_writer_debug_delay_ms=2000`, and `async_writer_max_queued=2`. This
validates queue-capacity mechanics under synthetic writer backpressure, not a
real throughput win; async writer promotion still needs a representative
writer-heavy workload or scheduler result that beats the serial payload boundary
without DNG mismatches.

Batch CDNG codec selector:
`MLVApp --batch` still defaults to uncompressed CDNG, but `--cdng-codec
lossless` now selects the existing lossless-JPEG DNG path and `--cdng-codec
fast-pass` selects the existing pass-through mode. The release profiling
wrappers carry the same selector into single, A/B, and matrix runs. This is
tooling for the next E3 proof: it makes a representative lossless-output,
writer/heavier-compress matrix possible without broadening the production
default or changing GUI export behavior.
The committed-build lossless smoke at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-codec-lossless-smoke-037d3d59/profile.json`
ran build `037d3d5940e4989eac5ba6f3d74b289225819af0`, logged
`cdng-codec=lossless`, exported two `compressed_raw` frames, and recorded two
`dng_compress_ms` samples (average 58.84905 ms). The matching lossless
payload-handoff A/B smoke at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-codec-lossless-payload-ab-037d3d59/summary.json`
reported `cdngCodec=lossless`, `verdict=PASS`, and the two baseline/candidate
DNG pairs matched byte-for-byte
(`A4356D40D811982CF08D0900F5AC68B5C7A76B0918B614AA71E63DAD9F9838A1` and
`7D6D00C078EAE41326F1801DFBCD3A5872D7DFDADE962CBC90E71616EF758D51`). This
proves the lossless profiling surface and serial payload boundary work together
on a two-frame smoke; it is not a throughput promotion or scheduler claim.
The follow-up lossless real-footage matrix at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-payload-matrix-74b52e39/matrix-summary.json`
ran build `74b52e3900d7230ba806165937c3489057df2b5c` on the same three clips
and receipt with `--cdng-codec lossless`, `maxFrames=8`, `repeats=2`,
`-AlternateRunOrder`, and serial payload handoff. Verdict: PASS, 6/6 runs. The
separate hash sweep at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-payload-matrix-74b52e39/dng-hash-comparison.json`
reported 48/48 baseline-vs-payload DNG pairs matched by length and SHA256, with
0 mismatches and 0 missing files. Aggregate payload handoff cost averaged
0.011327 ms, while wrapper elapsed averaged +515.825 ms and frame-total average
delta averaged +61.088788 ms (p95 delta averaged -133.297083 ms). This broadens
the serial payload boundary's correctness evidence to lossless-output export,
but it still does not promote a throughput win: the matrix was short, timings
remain order/noise sensitive, and `dng_compress_ms` still runs producer-side
before any async writer handoff. Next E3 promotion work should therefore focus
on stronger sampling/statistical methodology or an explicit writer-heavy
scheduler result, not on treating this lossless PASS as broad export throughput
proof.
The matching lossless identity A/A matrix at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-identity-matrix-e41e7de1/matrix-summary.json`
also passed 6/6, and its hash sweep reported 48/48 DNG pairs matched with 0
mismatches. The v2 calibration packet at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-calibration-e41e7de1/calibration.json`
first compared that identity matrix against the earlier lossless payload matrix
and reported `verdict=EXCEEDS_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE`; profile review showed that
earlier payload matrix carried multi-second `disk_write_ms` outliers in both
baseline and candidate runs, while the fresh identity run stayed near 1-2 ms.
A same-condition payload rerun at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-payload-matrix-rerun-e41e7de1/matrix-summary.json`
passed 6/6 and its hash sweep again reported 48/48 matched DNG pairs with 0
mismatches. The calibrated rerun at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-calibration-rerun-e41e7de1/calibration.json`
still reported `verdict=EXCEEDS_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE`, but the boundary narrowed:
frame-total average positive max was inside the identity envelope
(33.859437 ms feature versus 35.658738 ms identity), while frame-total p95
positive max still exceeded it (67.1932 ms feature versus 43.6239 ms identity).
Payload handoff cost averaged 0.01451 ms. This keeps the lossless payload result
strictly in the correctness/tooling bucket: byte output is stable and the
handoff itself is tiny, but the current short lossless timing envelope still
blocks throughput promotion for that path.
The broader lossless 16-frame x 3-repeat matrices at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-identity-matrix-16x3-e41e7de1/matrix-summary.json`
and
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-payload-matrix-16x3-e41e7de1/matrix-summary.json`
both passed 9/9; their hash sweeps each reported 144/144 matched DNG pairs with
0 mismatches. The v3 calibration with stage attribution at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-calibration-16x3-e41e7de1/calibration-with-stage-attribution.json`
still reported `verdict=EXCEEDS_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE`: frame-total p95 positive
max was inside identity (81.4423 ms feature versus 95.7494 ms identity), but
frame-total average positive max exceeded it (43.329938 ms feature versus
23.927175 ms identity). Stage attribution puts the feature average miss mostly
in `llrawproc_ms` (+8.180042 ms average), while `dng_compress_ms` and
`disk_write_ms` stayed inside identity and payload handoff averaged 0.016103 ms.
This strengthens the hold without pointing at payload-copy cost: the lossless
payload boundary is byte-correct, but current timing evidence still needs either
a stronger same-stage/noise model or a real scheduler win before promotion.
The matching current-release async-writer lossless matrix at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-matrix-16x3-current/matrix-summary.json`
used serial payload handoff plus `-CandidateUseAsyncWriter`,
`-CandidateAsyncWriterQueueDepth 2`, `--cdng-codec lossless`, the same three
clips/receipt, 16 frames, and 3 repeats. Its hash sweep at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-matrix-16x3-current/dng-hash-comparison.json`
reported 144/144 baseline-vs-candidate DNG pairs matched by length and SHA256,
with 0 mismatches and 0 missing files, and all cases reached
`async_writer_max_queued=2`. The v4 calibrated identity-vs-async packet at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-calibration-16x3-current-v4/calibration.json`
reported `verdict=EXCEEDS_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE` with
`blockingReasons=feature_exceeds_identity_frameTotalAvgDeltaMs,feature_exceeds_identity_frameTotalP95DeltaMs`.
Wrapper elapsed improved strongly (`elapsedDeltaMs` feature average
-7214.264222 ms, inside the identity envelope), but frame-total average and p95
deltas failed the envelope (`frameTotalAvgDeltaMs` feature average
+1043.311510 ms, feature positive max +3852.859176 ms; `frameTotalP95DeltaMs`
feature average +1612.453544 ms, feature positive max +6837.739600 ms). Stage
attribution names `writerCompletionLagAvgDeltaMs` as both the dominant positive
feature-average stage (+1565.818632 ms) and dominant positive-max excess stage
(+4281.253201 ms), with `writerQueueWaitAvgDeltaMs` also high (+876.454149 ms
feature average). The new scheduler attribution makes the split explicit:
`producerFrameAvgDeltaMs` improved by -522.507122 ms on average and
`producerQueueIdleAvgDeltaMs` stayed inside the identity envelope, while
`writerCompletionLagP95DeltaMs` was the dominant scheduler hotspot
(+3077.546722 ms feature average, +9118.773400 ms positive-max excess). This is
a useful async result but still a HOLD, not a promotion: the bytes are stable
and the writer can overlap enough to improve wrapper elapsed, but the current
completion gate says backlog/lag is part of the frame cost. Next E3 async work
should reduce queue wait/completion lag with scheduler policy before considering
any separately justified async-aware promotion gate; it should not claim success
from elapsed-only improvement.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 writer-parallel experiment: the async writer now has
a bounded opt-in worker-count knob, `MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_ASYNC_WRITER_THREADS`
(`-AsyncWriterThreadCount`, surfaced through the A/B and matrix runners). The
default remains one worker. Profiler JSON records the effective
`async_writer_thread_count` plus utilization counters
(`async_writer_jobs_started`, `async_writer_jobs_finished`,
`async_writer_max_active`), and the pipeline suite includes a two-worker tiny
DNG byte-identity test before any real-footage matrix can use the knob. This is
the next measurement step for the `writerCompletionLagP95DeltaMs` blocker above,
not a promoted scheduler policy; `async_writer_max_active=1` on a multi-worker
run means the extra configured workers did not overlap actual writes.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 writer-parallel matrix: the bounded lossless
real-footage matrix at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-threads2-matrix-16x3-f4140eaa/matrix-summary.json`
used serial baseline versus payload-handoff plus async writer, queue depth 2,
writer threads 2, three 16-frame M16 cases, three repeats, alternating run
order, and frame-total regression gates. The DNG hash comparison at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-threads2-matrix-16x3-f4140eaa/dng-hash-comparison.json`
passed with 144/144 matched pairs and zero missing or mismatched DNGs. The raw
feature gate was still FAIL (8 pass / 1 fail): `m16-1347-master-lossless`
repeat 2 regressed `frame_total_ms` average by 9.076% and p95 by 39.807%.
Calibration against the same-build alternating identity matrix at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-threads2-calibration-16x3-f4140eaa/calibration.json`
reported `verdict=EXCEEDS_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE`, `identityRawGateUnstable=True`,
and `blockingReasons=feature_exceeds_identity_frameTotalAvgDeltaMs`. The
positive-max miss was small on frame-total average (`featurePositiveMax`
17.254725 ms versus identity 16.493232 ms; margin -0.761493 ms), and p95 plus
producer-frame metrics were inside the identity envelope, but writer completion
lag remained outside (`writerCompletionLagAvgDeltaMs` feature average
+2.328465 ms, positive max +4.481581 ms; `writerCompletionLagP95DeltaMs`
feature average +2.835678 ms). `candidateAsyncWriterMaxQueued` stayed 1 in all
9 runs, so the second worker did not materially engage on this workload. This
keeps two-worker async at HOLD: byte-correct and instrumented, but not a
promoted throughput policy. Next E3 work should stop chasing worker count on
this default/lossless M16 set unless a representative writer-heavy workload
actually fills the queue; prioritize either writer-utilization instrumentation
or the next higher-roadmap export bottleneck.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 writer-utilization rerun: the committed release
build `40b096942f1017b7ed4d0e80e0a2adea385fb301` first passed a one-frame
release smoke at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-async-util-release-smoke-40b09694/profile.json`
with `async_writer_thread_count=2`, `async_writer_queue_capacity=2`,
`async_writer_jobs_started=1`, `async_writer_jobs_finished=1`, and
`async_writer_max_active=1`. The follow-on lossless M16 16-frame x 3-repeat
matrix at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-threads2-util-matrix-16x3-40b09694/matrix-summary.json`
used serial baseline versus payload-handoff plus async writer, queue depth 2,
writer threads 2, alternating run order, and frame-total regression gates.
The DNG hash comparison at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-threads2-util-matrix-16x3-40b09694/dng-hash-comparison.json`
passed with 144/144 matched pairs and zero missing or mismatched DNGs. The raw
feature gate still failed (6 pass / 3 fail): candidate jobs started/finished
were 144/144, but `candidateAsyncWriterMaxActive=1` and
`candidateAsyncWriterMaxQueued=1` in every run, writer queue wait stayed
0.000 ms (no finite FPS-equivalent), average frame total regressed
+5.039792 ms (198.421 FPS-equivalent), p95 frame total regressed
+16.953133 ms (58.986 FPS-equivalent), writer-completion lag averaged
+2.333110 ms (428.612 FPS-equivalent), writer-completion p95 averaged
+2.750689 ms (363.545 FPS-equivalent), and payload clone averaged
+0.011989 ms (83,410.565 FPS-equivalent). A same-build identity matrix at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-identity-matrix-16x3-40b09694/matrix-summary.json`
was itself strict-gate noisy (5 pass / 4 fail) but byte-identical
(`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-identity-matrix-16x3-40b09694/dng-hash-comparison.json`
also passed 144/144). Calibration at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-lossless-async-threads2-util-calibration-16x3-40b09694/calibration.json`
reported `verdict=EXCEEDS_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE`, `identityRawGateUnstable=True`,
and blocking reasons `feature_exceeds_identity_frameTotalAvgDeltaMs` plus
`feature_exceeds_identity_frameTotalP95DeltaMs`: frame-total average positive
max was 30.980219 ms (32.279 FPS-equivalent) versus identity 20.566243 ms
(48.624 FPS-equivalent), and frame-total p95 positive max was 100.972900 ms
(9.904 FPS-equivalent) versus identity 85.160000 ms (11.743 FPS-equivalent).
The dominant positive feature-average stage was `llrawprocAvgDeltaMs` at
+4.108379 ms (243.405 FPS-equivalent), and the dominant scheduler positive-max
excess was `producerFrameAvgDeltaMs` at +8.041832 ms (124.350
FPS-equivalent). This supersedes the earlier "add utilization counters" next
step: two-worker async remains HOLD, not a promoted throughput policy, and the
M16 lossless/default workload does not keep a second writer active. Next E3
work should stop widening writer count on this set and either use a genuinely
writer-heavy representative output scenario or move to the next export
bottleneck.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 larger-clip async probe: the largest local MLV,
`C:\temp\MLV\M29-1756.MLV`, was used as a bounded four-frame lossless-output
probe on committed release build `54787f8f` to see whether a bigger local source
creates real writer pressure. Baseline-first output lives at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-m29-lossless-async-probe-54787f8f/`;
candidate-first output lives at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-m29-lossless-async-probe-candidatefirst-54787f8f/`.
`tools/profiling/compare-cdng-dng-output-hashes.ps1 -AbSummary` and its
`-SummaryJson` alias validated both bundles as byte-identical baseline/candidate
DNGs for all 4/4 frames, writing `dng-hash-comparison.json` beside each
standalone summary. The async candidate used payload handoff, queue depth 2, and
writer threads 2, but both run orders still reported
`async_writer_max_active=1` and `async_writer_max_queued=1`. Elapsed deltas were
order-sensitive (`-1454.373 ms` baseline-first versus `-102.329 ms`
candidate-first), while frame-total averages regressed (`+10.4989 ms` and
`+19.045225 ms`) and writer-completion lag remained small (`+2.278675 ms` and
`+1.9589 ms`). This keeps async writer at HOLD on available local footage: M29
is useful coverage, but it still does not supply the representative writer-heavy
workload needed to justify scheduler-policy work. Next E3 work should either
find or construct a true writer-dominant export scenario, or move to the next
measured export bottleneck rather than widening async writer count again.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 bottleneck breakdown: export stage profiles now
include the same `llrawproc_*` substage split used by playback telemetry,
including `llrawproc_total_ms`, dark-frame/stripe/focus/bad/pattern fixes,
pre-dual-ISO fix, dual-ISO, chroma smoothing, shared/refine/publish lock time,
and `llrawproc_other_ms`. Profiles also record per-frame GPU export attempt,
return-code, replacement, and allocation telemetry, while A/B and matrix
summaries surface candidate GPU-export attempt/replacement/allocation counters
for future UltraMagnus proof packets. A rebuilt release-tree smoke on
`platform/qt/build-release/release/MLVApp.exe` at commit `3fc78aee` wrote
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-gpu-telemetry-profile-smoke-3fc78aee/profile.json`
from `C:\temp\MLV\M29-1756.MLV` with two lossless-output frames. On this VM the
GPU-export counters correctly stayed inactive:
`gpu_export_attempted_frames=0`, `gpu_export_replaced_frames=0`, and
`gpu_export_max_allocated_bytes=0`; this is local fallback telemetry, not
UltraMagnus GPU proof. The measured `frame_total_ms` average was 361.06 ms
(2.77 FPS-equivalent). The dominant local bottleneck was `llrawproc_total_ms`
at 265.50 ms (3.77 FPS-equivalent), almost entirely `llrawproc_dual_iso_ms` on
this clip, followed by `dng_compress_ms` at 76.17 ms (13.13 FPS-equivalent).
`disk_write_ms` stayed small at 1.48 ms (674.90 FPS-equivalent). A one-frame
release A/B wrapper smoke at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-gpu-telemetry-ab-smoke-3fc78aee/`
reported the same zero GPU-attempt/replacement counters, preserved the new
summary fields, and passed standalone DNG hash comparison 1/1. This reinforces
the async-writer HOLD decision on available local footage: the next E3
implementation should target dual-ISO/recon scheduling and/or compression
placement/parallelism, not disk write overlap alone.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 GPU-candidate proof packet: the A/B and matrix
profiling wrappers now support per-side GPU export controls. The legacy
`-EnableGpuExport` switch still enables both baseline and candidate for
same-mode runs, while `-BaselineEnableGpuExport` and
`-CandidateEnableGpuExport` allow a clean CPU-baseline versus GPU-candidate
UltraMagnus proof packet. The local VM validation used the existing release
tree and working-tree wrapper changes only: A/B
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-candidate-gpu-switch-local-2f0cade8/`
and matrix
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-candidate-gpu-switch-matrix-local-2f0cade8/`
both recorded `baseline.enableGpuExport=false`,
`candidate.enableGpuExport=true`, zero local GPU attempts/replacements, and
DNG hash PASS 1/1. This is VM-local fallback/tooling proof only; real export GPU
promotion still needs an UltraMagnus run whose candidate attempts and replaces
the expected frames with matching DNG hashes.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 GPU proof gates: the same A/B and matrix wrappers
now have opt-in promotion gates for CPU-baseline/GPU-candidate runs:
`-RequireBaselineNoGpuExportAttempt`, `-RequireCandidateGpuExportAttempt`, and
`-RequireCandidateGpuExportReplacement`. The ordinary local fallback A/B
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-proof-gate-pass-local-51e19138/`
still passed and its DNG hash check matched 1/1. The intentionally gated local
A/B
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-proof-gate-expected-fail-local-51e19138/`
and matrix
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-proof-gate-matrix-expected-fail-local-51e19138/`
failed closed because the VM candidate attempted 0/1 frames and replaced 0/1
frames. This is the desired local behavior: a real UltraMagnus export promotion
packet must pass those gates, then pass the DNG hash companion.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 UltraMagnus export wrapper:
`tools\profiling\invoke-ultramagnus-cdng-export-evidence.ps1` now stages a clean
repo over the existing SMB agent channel, builds/deploys `igpu_recon_cuda.dll`
on UltraMagnus, rebuilds the release tree there, runs the CDNG matrix wrapper as
CPU baseline versus GPU candidate, and requires baseline no-attempt, candidate
attempt/replacement, and DNG hash identity before `gpuExportValidated=true`.
The compact imported evidence packet lives under
`.claude-state\profiling\ultramagnus-cdng-export\` and carries matrix summaries,
hash comparison, release/backend hashes, and remote host/GPU context without
zipping bulky DNG payloads. This is the correct proof path for export GPU
promotion; VM-local runs remain fallback/tooling checks. If UltraMagnus lacks
the Qt/MinGW release-build tree, the wrapper fails with a durable recovery path:
rebuild the release tree locally, stage it, and rerun with `-SkipRemoteBuild`
while still building/deploying the CUDA backend and running proof gates on the
4090 host.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 GPU export skip diagnostics: export profiles now
distinguish "candidate did not attempt GPU export" from why it did not attempt.
The root profile has `gpu_export_skipped_frames` and
`gpu_export_skip_reason_counts`, and each frame records
`gpu_export_skip_code` / `gpu_export_skip_reason`. A/B summaries copy those
counts to baseline/candidate, matrix rows preserve them, and UltraMagnus proof
failures include a compact `skip_counts=...` rollup. Release-tree local smoke
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-gpu-export-skip-telemetry-smoke/` used an
existing non-DLL file as `-CandidateGpuExportDll`; the candidate stayed
byte-inert with `gpuExportAttemptedFrames=0`, `gpuExportSkippedFrames=1`, and
`backend_unavailable=1`, while the CPU baseline reported `disabled=1`. This is
still VM-local tooling proof. The next UltraMagnus packet must use the same
fields to explain any candidate 0/N attempt gate before changing receipts or
promotion criteria.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 UltraMagnus proof receipt gate: the first
skip-diagnostic UltraMagnus rerun at
`.claude-state/profiling/ultramagnus-cdng-export/imported/packet-20260619T171930/`
proved the host/backend/hash sides but failed the GPU replacement gate with
`skip_counts=missing_recon_state=4` for both uncompressed and lossless runs.
The source receipt had `dualIsoInterpolation=0`, which is outside the exporter
GPU state publisher's supported gate. The UltraMagnus wrapper now generates an
effective proof receipt from the source receipt by forcing
`dualIsoInterpolation=1`, alias-map on, full-res blending on, and chroma-smooth
off; `-UseReceiptAsIs` preserves the old raw-receipt behavior for debugging.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 UltraMagnus export proof packet: rerun
`.claude-state/profiling/ultramagnus-cdng-export/imported/packet-20260619T172721/`
passed with status `success` and `gpuExportValidated=true`. The packet ZIP is
`.claude-state/profiling/ultramagnus-cdng-export/remote-packets/ultra-magnus-20260619T172721-mlvapp-cdng-export-evidence-latest.zip`

It records host `ULTRA-MAGNUS`, `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, 596.36, 24564 MiB`,

`A63212BDA5C6439257D2100F9EA1A5F490A25F740FD9961325F5683552CE3D65`. Both
`uncompressed` and `lossless` cases passed: the CPU baseline attempted 0 GPU
frames and reported four `disabled` skips, the GPU candidate attempted and
replaced 4/4 frames with zero candidate skips, and the DNG hash companion passed
8/8 matched pairs. This closes the scoped 4090 export replacement/byte-identity
proof for the generated FastProxy proof receipt; it does not claim a general
throughput win. The 4-frame, single-repeat packet reported uncompressed elapsed
delta +87.802 ms (+2.466%) and lossless elapsed delta -247.457 ms (-5.627%),
so E3 throughput/pipeline promotion still needs the separate real-footage
matrix and scheduler/compression bottleneck work.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 UltraMagnus throughput probe: the larger follow-up
`.claude-state/profiling/ultramagnus-cdng-export/imported/packet-20260619T173809/`
used the same 4090 proof path on committed source head
`94f79915f62b76ef8e09b8ff9603cd7ae5379eb4`, release executable SHA256
`4B9405DED35B15A33972AF4844B11455484F806A222F527C40ACCE44634630F2`, generated
FastProxy proof receipt, `M16-1327.MLV`, both `uncompressed` and `lossless`
CDNG, `maxFrames=16`, and `repeats=3`. The packet ZIP is
`.claude-state/profiling/ultramagnus-cdng-export/remote-packets/ultra-magnus-20260619T173809-mlvapp-cdng-export-evidence-latest.zip`
(SHA256 `F2CF60E1B600D30551AA91B04D3972CF859B0788C4ABE1F1E514602ECCC2C56E`).
Correctness stayed green: 6/6 matrix runs passed, CPU baseline attempted 0 GPU
frames, the GPU candidate attempted and replaced 16/16 frames in every repeat
with zero candidate skips, and the DNG hash companion matched 96/96 pairs. The
throughput result is a blocker, not a promotion: elapsed time regressed in every
repeat. Uncompressed averaged +384.453 ms elapsed (+8.209%) and +18.359 ms
frame-total average, with the added time concentrated in `llrawproc_total_ms`
/ `llrawproc_dual_iso_ms` (+20.479 ms average). Lossless averaged +800.083 ms
elapsed (+13.759%) and +32.465 ms frame-total average, again dominated by
`llrawproc_total_ms` / `llrawproc_dual_iso_ms` (+28.917 ms / +28.896 ms
average) while compression was roughly neutral. This keeps GPU export as a
scoped replacement/parity proof, not an E3 throughput win; this packet measured
the default shadow validator, which still pays the CPU Dual-ISO oracle plus the
GPU run and byte comparison. Next E3 work should use the trusted GPU export
gate above to measure the candidate without shadow-validation cost, then either
promote only if the trusted UltraMagnus packet wins with DNG hashes green or
move to a different measured export bottleneck.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 DNG hash gate: A/B and matrix wrappers now accept
`-RequireDngHashMatch`, run the existing DNG SHA256 companion, and fold its
verdict into `summary.json` / `matrix-summary.json` as `dngHash`. Local VM
validation stayed headless and fallback-only: A/B
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-dng-hash-gate-ab-pass-local-08c15d25/`
and matrix
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-dng-hash-gate-matrix-pass-local-08c15d25/`
both reported `dngHash.verdict=PASS` with 1/1 matched pairs. Promotion packets
can now require candidate GPU replacement and DNG byte identity in one wrapper
verdict instead of relying on a follow-up manual hash sweep.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 compression telemetry: export profiles now record
compressed-DNG byte counts alongside `dng_compress_ms`: root
`dng_compress_bytes_valid_frames`, `dng_compress_input_bytes_total`, and
`dng_compress_output_bytes_total`, plus per-frame
`dng_compress_bytes_valid`, `dng_compress_input_bytes`, and
`dng_compress_output_bytes`. This keeps the next compression-placement or
parallelism experiment tied to byte throughput rather than timing alone.
Release-tree headless validation at commit `b3cabaf6` wrote
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-compress-byte-telemetry-b3cabaf6/profile.json`
from `C:\temp\MLV\M29-1756.MLV` with two lossless-output frames:
`dng_compress_bytes_valid_frames=2`,
`dng_compress_input_bytes_total=16402176`, and
`dng_compress_output_bytes_total=7996908`. The measured `dng_compress_ms`
average was 74.98 ms (13.34 FPS-equivalent), while `frame_total_ms` averaged
387.86 ms (2.58 FPS-equivalent). This is VM-local batch telemetry only, not an
UltraMagnus GPU proof packet.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 compression summary plumbing: the export-stage
comparator now emits a `compression` object for the compressed-DNG root byte
counters, input/output MiB/s, and output ratio. A/B `summary.json` copies those
values onto `baseline`, `candidate`, and `compare`, and matrix `runs[]` rows
carry the same compression totals and throughput deltas. Future E3 proof
packets can now filter `matrix-summary.json` directly instead of opening every
raw profile to compute compression throughput by hand. Headless VM-local
tooling validation passed with DNG hash PASS 1/1 for A/B
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-compression-summary-ab-smoke/`
and matrix
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-compression-summary-matrix-smoke/`;
both carried `dngCompressOutputBytesTotalDelta=0` and populated
`dngCompressOutputMiBPerSecondDelta` in the generated summaries.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 compression calibration: the matrix calibration
tool now carries compression byte, output-ratio, and input/output MiB/s deltas
under a non-blocking `compressionThroughput` section. These metrics are
positive-good when throughput improves and are intentionally kept out of the
frame-regression verdict path; frame timing remains governed by the identity
envelope gates. Headless validation used one-frame identity and feature
matrices with DNG hash PASS 1/1:
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-compression-calibration-identity-smoke/`
and
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-compression-calibration-feature-smoke/`.
The final calibration artifact
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-e3-compression-calibration-smoke-final/calibration.json`
reported `verdict=WITHIN_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE`,
`compressionThroughput.participatesInFrameRegressionVerdict=false`, and no
blocking reasons.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 compression substage telemetry: the export profile
keeps `dng_compress_ms` as the rollup and now splits it into
`dng_compress_encode_ms`, `dng_compress_copy_ms`, and
`dng_compress_cleanup_ms`; A/B summaries, matrix rows, and calibration
attribution carry the matching `dngCompress*AvgDeltaMs` fields. Headless
VM-local schema validation, not GPU proof, wrote
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-compress-substage-smoke/profile.json`
from the checked-in tiny Dual ISO fixture with one lossless-output frame:
`dng_compress_ms=62.6934` ms (15.95 FPS-equivalent),
`dng_compress_encode_ms=61.8549` ms (16.17 FPS-equivalent),
`dng_compress_copy_ms=0.4372` ms (2287.46 FPS-equivalent), and
`dng_compress_cleanup_ms=0.3967` ms (2520.81 FPS-equivalent). Wrapper smoke
artifacts also passed DNG identity checks 1/1:
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-compress-substage-ab-smoke/summary.json`,
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-compress-substage-matrix-smoke/matrix-summary.json`,
and
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-compress-substage-calibration-smoke/calibration.json`
with `verdict=WITHIN_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE`.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 compression placement guard: export profiles now
make the current scheduler boundary explicit with
`dng_compress_placement=producer_before_payload` and
`async_writer_can_overlap_dng_compress=false`. The export-stage comparator,
A/B summaries, and matrix rows carry those fields forward, so future async
writer packets cannot infer writer-side compression overlap from elapsed-time
improvements while LJ92 encode still runs before payload enqueue. This is a
guardrail and methodology improvement only; it does not move compression to a
worker thread or claim throughput promotion.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 async-writer compression experiment: an opt-in
`MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_ASYNC_WRITER_COMPRESS=1` path, surfaced by
`-UseAsyncWriterCompression` in the profiling runners, can now move
`COMPRESSED_RAW` LJ92 compression after payload enqueue onto the async writer.
The default producer-side path is unchanged. The writer-side path carries the
processed uncompressed payload, compresses it before disk write, patches the
DNG `StripByteCounts` header field, and profiles the run as
`dng_compress_placement=async_writer_after_payload` with
`async_writer_can_overlap_dng_compress=true`. This is an experimental E3
candidate surface, not a promoted throughput policy; promotion still requires
release-tree byte identity plus a bounded calibrated real-footage matrix.

The bounded calibrated matrix at
`.claude-state/profiling/2026-06-19-cdng-async-writer-compress-master-matrix-8x2-calibration/calibration.json`
used the established three M16 cases (`M16-1210`, `M16-1327`, `M16-1347`),
`C:\temp\MLV\master.marxml`, `--cdng-codec lossless`, `maxFrames=8`,
`repeats=2`, alternating order, serial baseline, and async-writer-compression
candidate with queue depth 2. The feature matrix raw wrapper passed 6/6 runs,
and both identity/feature DNG hash sweeps passed 48/48 matched pairs with zero
missing or mismatched DNGs. The candidate correctly reported
`dng_compress_placement=async_writer_after_payload`,
`async_writer_can_overlap_dng_compress=true`, and
`async_writer_compress_env_enabled=true`, but calibration still reported
`verdict=EXCEEDS_IDENTITY_ENVELOPE` with
`feature_exceeds_identity_frameTotalAvgDeltaMs` and
`feature_exceeds_identity_frameTotalP95DeltaMs`. The candidate improved average
producer-frame time by 77.433 ms, but shifted compression to the completion
gate: `writerCompletionLagAvgDeltaMs` averaged +90.833 ms and
`writerCompletionLagP95DeltaMs` averaged +103.722 ms, while feature positive
max frame-total deltas exceeded identity (`avg` +70.217 ms vs +27.914 ms;
`p95` +179.314 ms vs +23.339 ms). Async queue depth stayed effectively unused
(`candidateAsyncWriterMaxQueued=1`, `candidateAsyncWriterMaxActive=1`). This
keeps async-writer compression byte-correct but non-promoted; next E3 work
should either find a workload that actually fills the writer queue, or move to
the next export bottleneck instead of treating producer-time improvement alone
as throughput proof.

Update 2026-06-19 Lane A E3 combined proof surface: now that the trusted GPU
export measurement gate removes the CPU shadow-oracle cost, the UltraMagnus
CDNG export evidence wrapper can run candidate-only async-writer compression
through the same remote proof path using `-CandidateUseAsyncWriter`,
`-CandidateUseAsyncWriterCompression`, `-CandidateAsyncWriterQueueDepth`, and
`-CandidateAsyncWriterThreadCount`. Use this to test whether trusted GPU recon
plus writer-side LJ92 compression changes the older non-promoted lossless
result while still requiring baseline no-GPU, candidate GPU
attempt/replacement, candidate trusted frames, and DNG hash match.

The three-clip UltraMagnus combined packet at
`.claude-state/profiling/ultramagnus-cdng-export/imported/packet-20260619T181722/summary.json`
with local packet
`.claude-state/profiling/ultramagnus-cdng-export/remote-packets/ultra-magnus-20260619T181722-mlvapp-cdng-export-evidence-latest.zip`
(SHA256 `380717DC753CFD7B01DDFE1E5348DBD402F5CF259DDC00D16D27B4D72AAD2155`)
passed on `ULTRA-MAGNUS` for commit
`7367ed8bb80e5bbe7105b6ff618ac775bae5ee3c`, release SHA256
`E99F592300AC8ACA00F3B238539711D3834DB1260228590A189A9532B00933A6`.
It used `M16-1210`, `M16-1327`, and `M16-1347`, `lossless`,
`maxFrames=16`, `repeats=3`, `-TrustedGpuExport`, queue depth 2, and two
candidate writer threads. Matrix result: 9/9 PASS, DNG hash PASS 144/144, and
candidate trusted/attempted/replaced frames 144/144/144. Average wall-clock
elapsed improved from 5706.215 ms to 4445.874 ms (-1260.341 ms, -22.048%);
per-clip wall-clock deltas were M16-1210 -1403.277 ms (-22.768%), M16-1327
-1247.415 ms (-22.598%), and M16-1347 -1130.333 ms (-20.779%). The candidate
also proved actual writer overlap (`candidateAsyncWriterMaxActive=2` in every
run, max queue 1-2). Keep the candidate opt-in for now: frame-total attribution
still averaged +19.773 ms and p95 +61.750 ms because producer-frame time
improved by -102.715 ms while writer-completion lag rose +122.487 ms and
writer-side compression averaged +11.200 ms. Next E3 work is to make the
promotion gate distinguish export wall-clock throughput from async
completion-lag attribution, then decide whether this lossless candidate can
move beyond proof/experiment mode. The first gate now exists as
`-RequireElapsedImprovement` / `-MinElapsedImprovementPercent` on the A/B,
matrix, and UltraMagnus wrappers; frame-total avg/p95 regression remains a
separate attribution gate via `-FailOnRegression`.

Gate-enforced refresh: the UltraMagnus packet at

reran the same three clips on commit
`b88fb04b465a4bb8af34471afae1130f74031491` with
`-RequireElapsedImprovement -MinElapsedImprovementPercent 10`. Result: 9/9
PASS, DNG hash PASS 144/144, candidate trusted/attempted/replaced frames
144/144/144, and every row cleared the 10% elapsed-improvement gate (minimum
row improvement 14.925%). Average wall-clock elapsed improved from 6570.353 ms
to 4934.366 ms (-1635.987 ms, -24.687%). Per-clip elapsed deltas were
M16-1210 -1426.806 ms (-21.689%), M16-1327 -1499.537 ms (-23.121%), and
M16-1347 -1981.617 ms (-29.251%). Frame-total attribution is now mixed but
bounded for review (overall avg +4.316 ms, p95 +12.605 ms; M16-1347 improved
frame-total while M16-1327 still carried positive completion lag), so default
promotion remains a separate policy decision.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

**Goals**
- Full-quality **x1 realtime** playback (the original moonshot) — no forced scale/quality compromises on capable hardware.
- **Faster CDNG export** (the repo's primary mission) with byte-exact output.
- One **backend contract** (`igpu_recon` C-ABI) so CUDA never leaks into the app; portable backends slot behind it.
- **Trustworthy UX**: quality labels mean exactly what they say; the app always shows its true active path.
- A permanent **CPU floor** — the app is fully usable with no GPU.

**Non-goals**
- Replacing the CPU path (it is the floor, not deprecated).
- Requiring a GPU.
- OpenGL-compute as the strategic portable target (it's frozen/deprecated on macOS).
- Rendered-video GPU export before processing parity lands.
- Bit-exactness *beyond* the engine's own float tolerance (its SSE2-vs-scalar variance is the reference, not a stricter bar).

## 2. Backend ladder and fallback rules

Ladder behind the single `igpu_recon` ABI:
```
CUDA      NVIDIA fast path (proven reference)
Vulkan    Win/Linux all-vendors + macOS via MoltenVK   (later)
Metal     macOS / Apple Silicon native                  (later)
CPU       universal fallback (permanent floor)
```
**Capability query** gates GPU use: *can this device do full recon + texture present with no per-frame readback?* — not merely "is a GPU present" (a weak iGPU can pass the latter and still not be worth it; the Tier 1 GL seam had a GPU and lost on readback).

**Fallback rules (all non-fatal):** missing DLL → CPU · no NVIDIA → CPU · GPU init failure → CPU · device/parity mismatch → CPU · **user selects Software → never touch the GPU** · **export always has a CPU correctness path**. No alarming modal unless the user explicitly requested GPU-only.

## 3. Lane A — GPU CDNG export (first; lowest risk, on-mission)

CDNG stores **post-recon Bayer** (debayer/processing happen later in the user's NLE), so only the **recon** stage needs the GPU — exactly the proven, ABI-wrapped, 0-LSB stage. Offline + readback-tolerant + file-diff-verifiable ⇒ the safest first production integration.
- **E0** export-stage profiler: decode / Dual-ISO recon / DNG pack / DNG compress / disk write / queue idle. Also includes an intentional CPU-export focal-plane resolution stability guard for same-process multi-frame DNG exports: frame 1 remains legacy byte-identical, while affected frames 2+ stop compounding the EXIF focal-plane denominator.
- **E1** GPU CDNG recon: CPU decode/unpack → CUDA recon (`IGPU_OUT_CPU16`) → read back Bayer16 → existing DNG writer unchanged. Behind `MLVAPP_GPU_EXPORT` / setting.
- **E2** export parity gate: CPU vs GPU exported DNGs match image payload + metadata (Look Assist defaults, resume, Dual-ISO pattern mapping, compressed + uncompressed). CPU fallback always.
- **E2 batch telemetry:** when a batch export actually attempts the CUDA shadow
  path and the backend exposes its optional VRAM query, stdout emits
  `[BATCH] GPU ... vramAllocatedMB=...` once per clip/resolution. The value is a
  backend working-set budget (tracked CUDA buffers plus the measured context
  reserve), not a WDDM per-PID reading; CPU-only and old-DLL runs stay silent.
- **E3** pipelined export: CPU decode workers → one GPU recon queue → CPU compress/write workers (never N processes fighting one GPU). A comparator for E0 export-stage profile JSONs now exists at `tools/profiling/compare-export-stage-profiles.ps1`, the profiler emits supported `queue_idle_ms`, `producer_queue_idle_ms`, `producer_frame_ms`, and `writer_completion_lag_ms` samples, `tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile.ps1` produces release-tree batch export profiles, `tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile-ab.ps1` bundles paired baseline/candidate profiles with a compare summary, `tools/profiling/run-release-cdng-export-profile-matrix.ps1` repeats those paired profiles across named cases into one matrix summary, and `dngFramePayload_t` now backs both the opt-in `MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_PAYLOAD_HANDOFF=1` serial boundary and the opt-in `MLVAPP_CDNG_EXPORT_ASYNC_WRITER=1` writer-worker boundary. Async writer queue depth and worker count both default to 1 and can be raised only by opt-in env/script parameters for bounded release-tree experiments, while the profiling-only async-writer debug delay can prove queue-capacity mechanics under synthetic writer backpressure. Candidate pipeline experiments can report per-stage avg/p50/p95 deltas, scheduler idle/gap avg/p95 deltas, caller-side producer occupancy, post-producer writer lag, payload handoff cost, wrapper wall-clock elapsed-time deltas, writer thread count, queue capacity/max-queued/debug-delay, and avg/p95 frame-total regression gates across a real-footage matrix before any scheduler rewrite is promoted.
- **E4** rendered-video export: later, only after processing parity; hardware encoders (NVENC/AMF/QSV) a separate lane. The headless batch CLI now exposes an explicit `--export-format` selector so automation can request the current `cdng` path deliberately; rendered-video aliases such as `rendered-video`, `video`, `mp4`, or `prores` are recognized as the E4 request class but fail closed with a prerequisite blocker until rendered processing parity and a headless rendered-export runner land.

## 4. Lane B — CUDA playback

- **P-pre (quality completion):** GPU **AMaZE debayer** parity (landed behind the
  DLL gate) + GPU **processing** parity + clean x1 CPU-vs-GPU frame diff. Required
  before the GUI may claim "GPU Full Quality AMaZE" (see §8).
- **P1** loader/fallback: load `igpu_recon_cuda.dll` if present + capable, else CPU. No hard dependency. Experimental playback bridge present behind `MLVAPP_GPU_PLAYBACK_RECON=1`.
- **P2** GPU recon + CPU readback: CUDA recon → Bayer16 readback → existing CPU debayer/process/present. Integration bridge, not final UX. Implemented for the v1 proven config only; missing/unsupported backend falls back to CPU.
- **P3** no-readback playback: CPU decode/prefetch -> CUDA recon -> CUDA-to-GL R16 texture present (no per-frame CPU readback for the displayed Bayer frame) is implemented and RTX 4090-validated for the scoped raw-fixes-enabled HQ Dual ISO shape. Readback-backed Bayer16 GL presentation remains the fallback presenter for P2 output; unsupported or non-proof states stay CPU/readback.
- **P4** adaptive quality + polish: hardware-capability-driven auto quality/scale, visible A/B + frame diffs, status UI, telemetry. Status/telemetry now distinguishes CPU, GPU preview, GPU recon readback, readback-backed texture present, and true no-readback texture present; the remaining adaptive work is to promote capability-aware defaults and quality decisions without exceeding the scoped P3 gate.
- Decode (LJ92, CPU, overlapped via prefetch ~7-9 ms @ 4.1 MP) is the steady-state gate once recon is on GPU — tune the overlap.

## 5. Lane C — portable GPU (later)

CUDA stays the reference. Add backends behind the same ABI: **Vulkan** (strategic Win/Linux all-vendors + Mac via MoltenVK), **Metal** (strategic macOS). **OpenGL** = presentation (the viewport is GL; CUDA→GL present proven) + optional *tactical* Win/Linux compute bridge — not the strategic compute target. Sequenced after Lanes A/B so effort isn't fragmented; the CPU oracle validates every new backend identically (0-LSB). The runtime loader now requests a named backend instead of hardcoding `"cuda"` at the ABI call site: `MLVAPP_GPU_PLAYBACK_RECON_BACKEND`, `MLVAPP_GPU_RECON_BACKEND`, and `MLVAPP_GPU_EXPORT_BACKEND` can select a future backend name, while the default remains `cuda` and missing/unsupported names fail closed to the CPU fallback path with telemetry reporting the requested name.

## 6. Quality modes and Expert controls

**Default UI — three modes (no jargon):**
```
Playback Mode:  Auto  |  Prioritize Quality  |  Prioritize Smoothness
```
- **Auto** (default): CUDA full-quality when validated + available; CPU full-quality when paused/scrubbing/exporting if needed; reduced-scale preview only when necessary to hold cadence; shows a small status (`GPU` / `CPU` / `Preview`).
- **Prioritize Quality:** true x1, selected/Advanced debayer, **no substitution**; if CUDA can't satisfy it, fall back to **software and say so** — never silently drop to bilinear or x4.
- **Prioritize Smoothness:** reduced-scale / faster debayer allowed to keep editing responsive; clearly preview-only — paused inspection and export stay full quality unless explicitly opted out.

**Expert Playback Settings (advanced, opt-in):**
```
Playback Engine:    Auto / GPU / Software
Preview Resolution: Auto / Full 1x / 1/2 / 1/4 / 1/8
Debayer Quality:    Auto / AMaZE / RCD / Bilinear / Basic   (labeled by intent — see §7)
Dual ISO Preview:   Auto / Full HQ / Fast Preview
Fallback Behavior:  Allow automatic fallback · Warn when quality is reduced
```
Advanced users can force `Full 1x · AMaZE` and accept dropped frames (the status shows the honest fps). The main UI never forces anyone to understand CUDA, recon, readback, or x4/x8.

## 7. Debayer / scale policy

Rank by **quality tier**, not a fake exact speed ladder (the advanced demosaics are quality *tradeoffs*). Label by intent:
```
Advanced  — AMaZE (Maximum detail) · RCD/LMMSE/AHD (High quality)
Fast      — Bilinear (Fast preview)
Minimal   — Basic / None (Fastest, last-resort cadence rescue)
```
- **Auto** moves between *tiers* by sustained cadence; it does **not** micromanage AMaZE-vs-RCD (no evidence to; revisit only if that changes).
- **Prioritize Quality / Expert-forced algorithm:** use it, or fall back to **CPU** for that algorithm — never silent-substitute bilinear under a "Full Quality" label.
- **Dual-ISO interpolation** folds into the same intent: Full Quality → AMaZE/HQ dual-ISO; Performance → mean23 / reduced. Don't expose "mean23" to normal users.
- **Scale** is **graceful auto-degradation** (invisible rungs Auto uses to hold cadence on weak HW), not a chore — though Expert can pin it. On capable GPUs the cost gap nearly vanishes (even AMaZE debayer ~1-2 ms), so the tradeoff usually disappears and full quality just plays.

## 8. Validation gates

- **Recon:** 0 LSB vs CPU oracle (mean23 + AMaZE dual-ISO logic) — done. AMaZE dual-ISO's shared float demosaic core is ±1-2 LSB = the engine's own SSE2-vs-scalar variance (policy: keep that subpath on CPU for "legacy-exact," or require explicit tolerance opt-in).
- **Debayer:** bilinear 0 LSB — done; **AMaZE debayer parity** landed as a
  DLL-gated/non-default production seam and remains non-GUI until the rest of
  P-pre is reviewed.
- **Processing:** **parity = P-pre**. The current gate covers the supported
  preview-processing subset (levels / matrix / camera matrix / gamut compression
  / gamma LUT path) through CPU-vs-GPU frame diffs; broader unsupported features
  still fail closed instead of silently using GPU.
- **Export (Lane A E2):** per-frame DNG image-payload + metadata byte-diff, compressed
  + uncompressed — **implemented + RTX-4090-validated** (CUDA `igpu_recon`). The GPU
  export shadow path engages *only* for the base HQ dual-ISO config (MEAN23 + alias-map
  ON + full-res ON + chroma OFF): there it replaces the CPU output byte-identically
  (`replaced==1`, SHA256 match) across {tiny,large} × {Look-Assist off/on} ×
  {uncompressed,compressed}. Every other config (alias/full-res OFF, AMAZE, chroma-smooth
  ON) is GPU-ineligible and falls back to CPU cleanly (`run_attempted==0`, `replaced==0`,
  CPU authoritative, DNG still byte-equal). Resume/partial export is byte-identical to a
  full run (per-frame export carries no cross-frame state). Tests: `DualIsoPipeline.
  GpuExport*` in `tests/pipeline/test_dual_iso_pipeline.cpp` — eligible matrix, ineligible
  fallback, resume proxy, and missing-DLL byte-inert; the GPU-engaging cases are gated on
  `MLVAPP_GPU_EXPORT_TEST_DLL` (skip on llvmpipe, run on the 4090).
- **Playback truth:** validate by *pixels* (PrintWindow / frame diff), never FPS alone — cadence can read perfect over a frozen frame.

**Parity-coupling (the honesty linchpin):** a quality option appears in the GUI **only after its parity gate passes** — so the UX rollout is staged with the engineering:

| Stage | Engineering done | GUI may honestly offer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | P2 / E1 (recon + bilinear, 0-LSB) | `GPU` engine; Full-Quality-AMaZE routes to **CPU**; GPU bilinear only under a labeled *Performance* mode |
| 2 | P-pre passes (AMaZE debayer + processing parity) | `GPU · Full Quality · AMaZE` becomes a true explicit path, with CPU AMaZE fallback reported instead of silent bilinear substitution |

P-pre is therefore both the engineering gate and the GUI-claim gate — it's what prevents a "Full Quality" toggle that silently isn't.

### 8.1 Processing-parity slices (extending P-pre to `allow_creative_adjustments`)

The GPU preview-processing shader today reproduces only the levels / matrix /
camera-matrix WB / gamut / gamma subset and fails closed on
`allow_creative_adjustments` (the creative grade). Extending it to full parity —
so a normally-graded clip can use the GPU path instead of falling back to CPU —
is staged as curve-first slices, because at the default image profile the
creative **contrast curve** (`pre_calc_curve_r`, built from the non-zero base
contrast params) is the only creative-family stage that is both active and
non-identity; gradation and toning execute but are identity, and
shadows/highlights and clarity are inert by default.

The post-gamma creative pipeline is ported as bit-aligned slices, in the exact
order `raw_processing.c` applies them (gamma → hue-vs → vibrance → saturation →
toning → contrast curve → gradation):

- **Slice 1 (DONE, `d77a26c6`):** creative contrast-curve LUT (`pre_calc_curve_r`)
  + gradation curves (`gcurve_*`) — 1D 16-bit LUT lookups, no spatial pass.
- **Slice 2 (DONE, `7c59d699`):** toning (per-channel `toning_dry + toning_wet`).
- **Slice 3 (DONE, `2e04516b`):** saturation (`Y1 + trunc((pix-Y1)*sat)`).
- **Slice 4 (DONE, `6ee4b4f3`):** vibrance (saturation-weighted blend).
- **Slice 5 (DONE):** hue-vs / luma-vs curves — RGB→HSV, four signed-`float[36000]`
  curve adjustments indexed by hue (`H*100`) and luma (`V*36000`), HSV→RGB. The
  curves are carried as **R32F** textures (units 11-14) so the GPU, the CPU
  reference and the production `float` curves stay bit-aligned (the uint16 LUT
  path would quantize the [-1,1] curve to ~3e-5 and break parity).
  - **Parity caveat (OOB clamp):** `hue_vs_luma` can push `V` to ≥ 1.0, after
    which `(uint16)(V*36000)` indexes `luma_vs_saturation[]` (exactly 36000
    entries) out of bounds — `V == 1.0` alone already yields index 36000. That
    read is undefined on the production CPU path, so both the GPU shader and the
    CPU reference **clamp the luma index to 35999** (the last valid sample)
    instead of reproducing undefined behaviour. This diverges from production
    only for boosted highlights (`V ≥ 1.0`) when a non-neutral
    `luma_vs_saturation` curve is set; clamping is the correct, deterministic
    behaviour and the production CPU path should adopt the same clamp (tracked
    separately — out of GPU-lane scope).
- **Slice 6 (DONE):** in-loop **simple-contrast factor** (`processing->contrast`,
  a per-pixel luma-dependent exposure multiply via `contrast_curve[cval]`,
  `raw_processing.c:2941-2954`). `cval` is the integer luma `(4R+11G+B)>>4` of the
  matrix-applied (pre camera-WB) pixel; the value is multiplied by
  `contrast_curve[cval]`. Because the factor is luma-dependent it cannot be folded
  into the per-channel matrix/gamma LUTs, so it is applied in-shader after the
  matrix sample and before the camera matrix/gamma (the scalar commutes with the
  linear WB). `contrast_curve` (`double[65536]`) is narrowed to `float` and carried
  as an R32F texture (unit 15).
- **Later slices (non-creative features, gated independently of the creative flag):**
  shadows/highlights + clarity (spatial RBF blur-mask pre-pass), then 1D/3D LUT,
  creative filter, AgX, median/RBF denoise, grain, CA correction, sharpen,
  vignette, non-Rec709 gamut.

**After slices 1-6 the creative-adjustments family is fully ported.**
`gpuPreviewProcessingIsSupported` no longer rejects `allow_creative_adjustments`
on its own — it accepts any grade (default or hand-graded: in-loop contrast +
hue-vs/luma-vs + vibrance + saturation + toning + contrast curve + gradation) and
fails closed only on the non-creative features listed above, which are gated
independently of the creative flag. The P-pre creative-parity goal (a normally
graded clip uses the GPU path instead of the CPU fallback) is met for the
creative-grade family, pending the RTX 4090 GL frame-diff that validates the
shader against this CPU reference.

Each slice keeps the CPU reference (`applyPreviewProcessingPixel`) and the GPU
subset shader bit-aligned, adds unit parity tests (the CPU reference is the local
bit-exact oracle), and is validated by a CPU-vs-GPU frame diff on the RTX 4090
before the support gate relaxes for that stage. P-pre — and the honest GUI
"GPU · Full Quality · AMaZE" claim per §8 stage 2 — completes when every creative
stage reaches parity.

### 8.2 Spatial-stages phase (completing P-pre beyond the creative family)

Update 2026-06-17: the creative family + the tractable non-creative per-pixel
stages (gamut / AgX / vignette / 1D-3D LUT) are ported and 4090-validated. The
remaining gate rejects were recon'd stage-by-stage and scoped in
[`gpu-lane-spatial-stages-scoping.md`](gpu-lane-spatial-stages-scoping.md). Key
correction to the earlier "the rest all need a blur pre-pass" assumption: most
remaining rejects are actually **per-pixel** (highlight reconstruction, gradient,
grain, creative filter) and only **chroma blur / sharpen / median** genuinely
need a neighborhood pass; **shadows/highlights, clarity, RBF denoise and CA** are
inherently **sequential** (a recursive bilateral filter / edge-window scan) and
are recommended to stay **CPU-fallback by design** (roadmap §9 honesty), not
bit-exact GPU ports. Two hard constraints drive the ranking: the shader is
**GLSL 110** (no bitwise ops/`uint`/`%` — all integer math float-emulated, which
blocks bit-exact grain and the NN sigmoid) and the **strict parity gate**
(≤16 LSB). The box blur (`blur_image`) is a separable integer box, bit-exactly
reproducible and validated in isolation before any consumer is wired. Order:
A) per-pixel bit-exact (highlight-recon → gradient); B) box-blur FBO infra +
chroma/sharpen/median; C) explicit CPU-fallback decision for the recursive
stages. See the scoping doc for the per-stage primitive table, apply-order map,
and the box-blur bit-exactness analysis.

## 9. UI truth / status language

Always surface the active path, quietly (no fake green lights, no alarms unless the user asked for GPU-only):
```
Playback: Full Quality · GPU · 1x · AMaZE
Playback: Full Quality · Software · 1x · AMaZE
Playback: Performance Preview · GPU · 1/4 · Bilinear
GPU unavailable: using software
```
Principles: **(1)** quality labels mean what they say; **(2)** preview compromises are allowed but *named* (reduced-scale / bilinear / mean23 = preview/performance); **(3)** Auto is smart but not mysterious — the status reveals the chosen path; **(4)** **export is sacred** — default deterministic + legacy-equivalent, any tolerance-based GPU path opt-in until proven; **(5)** fallback is a feature, not a failure (accelerator, not requirement); **(6)** Advanced controls exist without cluttering the main workflow.

North star: *"I can trust what I'm seeing and exporting,"* while the app quietly uses every bit of GPU speed it can safely use.

## Execution order (recommended)
1. **Lane A E0–E2** (GPU CDNG export, byte-exact) — lowest-risk first production use; serves the batch-export mission.
2. **P-pre** quality completion (AMaZE debayer + processing parity) — unlocks honest "GPU Full Quality" routing.
3. **Lane B P1–P4** (CUDA playback) — first explicit AMaZE playback routing, then the no-readback/user-facing realtime wins.
4. **Lane A E3–E4** (export pipeline + rendered/NVENC) and **Lane C** (Vulkan/Metal) as parallel/later tracks.

Supervised items (touch shipping `src/` or protected branch): all `src/` wiring in §3-4, and merging the work-block branch. The backend, parity harness, and this plan are ready.
