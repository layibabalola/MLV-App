/* Phase 4B: fused Bayer-to-RGB downsample-and-debayer.
 *
 * The pipeline still runs the full LJ92 decode + full llrawproc at native
 * resolution (these need the complete bitstream and Bayer pattern). After
 * llrawproc completes, the unpacked uint16 RGGB bayer image is fed into
 * pl_downsample_bayer_to_rgb_<2x|4x>, which produces a half-/quarter-res
 * RGB image directly via per-2x2-block channel averaging. The debayer
 * step is skipped entirely on the scaled path.
 *
 * Strategy: per 2x2 block of the source RGGB pattern, output one RGB pixel
 *   R := bayer[(0,0)]
 *   G := (bayer[(0,1)] + bayer[(1,0)]) / 2
 *   B := bayer[(1,1)]
 *
 * For scale=4, the 4x4 source region collapses to one RGB output pixel,
 * averaging 4 R taps, 8 G taps, and 4 B taps. The 4-row block stride
 * preserves the dual-ISO `iso_patterns[4][4]` cycle exactly — this is the
 * scale at which dual-ISO playback is correct.
 *
 * Output layout: AoS-3 (RGB interleaved per pixel), uint16 per channel.
 * The output bit depth is normalized to 16-bit; if the bayer input is in
 * 14-bit packed form the caller passes bit_shift=2 (or equivalent <<N).
 * Today video_mlv passes 0 because llrawproc has already widened to
 * 16-bit by the time we run.
 *
 * All kernels are AVX2-vectorised on x86_64 hosts; scalar fallback is
 * used otherwise. Dispatch is pthread_once-latched. Kill switches:
 *   MLVAPP_DISABLE_AVX2                — disables every AVX2 kernel
 *   MLVAPP_DISABLE_AVX2_DOWNSAMPLE     — disables only this kernel

/* Phase 4B-v2: Bayer-preserving downsample kernels.
 *
 * Output is uint16 RGGB Bayer at reduced resolution. Designed to be applied
 * BEFORE HQ Dual ISO recon (and before the rest of llrawproc that operates
 * on the bayer image), so that the recon runs on a much smaller buffer.
 *
 * The 4-row dual-ISO bright/dark pattern is preserved by sampling complete
 * 4-row source blocks and then skipping forward by an integer multiple of 4
 * rows for the next output block. For scale=4: keep src rows 0-3, skip
 * 4-15, keep 16-19, ... so that out_y=0..3 mirror src_y=0..3 (the full
 * iso_patterns 4-row cycle), out_y=4..7 mirror src_y=16..19, and so on.
 *
 * The X axis is downsampled by averaging same-Bayer-position taps inside a
 * 4-col (or 2-col) tile, which preserves the RGGB pattern at the smaller
 * resolution.
 *
 * Both kernels output uint16 with no bit-shift (we run BEFORE llrawproc, so
 * the input is the raw 14-bit-stored-as-uint16 values from
 * getMlvRawFrameUint16, and the output is the same range). llrawproc's
 * make_14bit / undo_14bit logic still works because the value range is
 * preserved.
 *
 * pl_downsample_bayer_to_bayer_4x_block_stride16:
 *   Output dim: (in_w/4, in_h/4).
 *   Y stride: keep complete 4-row blocks, block-stride 16 in source space.
 *   X downsample: 2x2 same-Bayer-position averaging inside 4-col tiles.
 *   in_w must be a multiple of 4. in_h must be a multiple of 16.
 *   When in_h is NOT a multiple of 16, falls back to 8-row block stride
 *   (block-stride 8 → Y/2) which still preserves the 4-row pattern but
 *   scales Y by 2 instead of 4.
 *
 * pl_downsample_bayer_to_bayer_2x_block_stride8:
 *   Output dim: (in_w/2, in_h/2).
 *   Y stride: keep complete 4-row blocks, block-stride 8 in source space.
 *   X downsample: take alternate Bayer cells (decimation, no averaging in X
 *   would still preserve RGGB; we average for anti-aliasing).
 *   in_w must be a multiple of 2. in_h must be a multiple of 8.
 *
 * Both return 0 on success, non-zero if dimensions don't satisfy the
 * stride constraints (in which case the caller must fall back to the v1
 * post-llrawproc path). */
