 * \file PlaybackFramePopulationPolicy.h
 * \brief Pure arithmetic: how many frames were actually asked for during a
 *        playback smoke session, and how many of those never reached
 *        presentation -- extracted so it can be unit-tested without the GUI.
 *
 * CUDA-ATTRIBUTION-BASELINE-1 round 2 (astra major 4 / sol major 1): a
 * monotonic render-request-serial delta is immune to timeline-position loop
 * wraps, but MainWindow::m_nextRenderRequestSerial advances for BOTH the one
 * target request drawFrame() issues per call and every speculative
 * render-lookahead request -- most of which are intentionally discarded
 * (never the frame playback ends up waiting on) and never reach
 * presentation. Using that counter's delta alone as the presented-frame
 * population denominator counts every discarded lookahead as "skipped",
 * overcounting loss whenever lookahead is enabled. The target-only counter
 * (MainWindow::m_nextTargetRenderRequestSerial) is both wrap-immune (same
 * monotonic-counter argument) and free of that overcount.

/*! CUDA-ATTRIBUTION-BASELINE-1 round 3 (astra major, prior finding 4 NOT

 *  request for it is invisible to all of them -- an "optimisation" that
 *  quietly requests fewer source frames passes cleanly. This struct starts
 *  instead from offeredSourceFrames (how many source frames the
 *  clip/timeline actually offered over the measured window, tracked by
 *  MainWindow::m_playbackTimelineSourceFramesOffered independent of request
 *  activity) and partitions it into four named, non-overlapping buckets that
 *  are PROVEN -- not assumed -- to sum back to it; see partitionSound.
 *
 *  CUDA-ATTRIBUTION-BASELINE-1 round 6 (astra major, "Request-event
 *  subtraction still certifies incorrect never-requested versus
 *  requested-then-skipped attribution"): the four buckets below are now
 *  derived from source-frame-OCCURRENCE IDENTITY sets (see
 *  PlaybackPresentedFrameIdentityTracker), not from subtracting a
 *  presented-frame count off a request-EVENT count. An event count
 *  overcounts "requested" whenever the same source frame is re-requested
 *  without advancing (e.g. drop-frame mode's m_frameChanged firing every
 *  timer tick regardless of whether the computed position crossed a
 *  whole-frame boundary), which used to misattribute those duplicate-event
 *  occurrences as requestedThenSkippedTargetFrames when they were in fact
 *  never-distinctly-requested. Bucket membership is now decided by one rule
 *  a test can name directly: an occurrence is presented if it is a member of
 *  either presented-occurrence set; requested-then-skipped/discarded if it
 *  is a member of the corresponding requested-occurrence set but not
 *  presented; never-requested if it is not a member of either
