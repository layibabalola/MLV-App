# Orchestration tiering (owner ruling 2026-09-08, adjudicated, veto open)

Standing owner instruction, September 8, 2026: Fable spends tokens only on important complex
reviews; Opus is the hub-lane traffic cop; Haiku reports status in chat sessions; adjudication
swarms are Opus; when Fable is exhausted, fall back to Opus at high effort. This document is the
tracked pointer; the decision record with measurements and the packet order lives in
`.claude-state/continuity/ORCHESTRATION-TIERING-20260908.md` (gitignored, canonical checkout only).
It composes with [error-remediation.md](error-remediation.md) and the fleet ruling that the
inference tier follows the highest-stakes act a surface performs.

## Tiers

| tier | model | effort | does | never does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| judgement | Fable (`claude-fable-5` lane, or a Fable chat session) | low by default; high only for a Tier 1 decision | consequential reviews, design, doctrine-fold decisions, one hard adjudication per packet | implement, ratification loops, routine cards, the hub loop |
| judgement, cross-family | Codex Astra (`gpt-6-astra`) | xhigh | the same class as Fable when a cross-family seat is wanted: guard, merge, commit or ratification-path changes; contested Sol verdicts | anything routine; not reachable from codex-cli 0.147.0 (probe before adding a lane) |
| hub | Opus | high | derive board, pick ONE packet, dispatch ONE editing lane in an isolated worktree, verify the receipt, refresh the checkpoint, reconcile queue rows through the verified writer | edit product source, build, run probes itself |
| adjudication swarm | Opus, three briefs (against the default; what outranks it; post-mortem and evidence binding) | low | any blocker or "what next"; a new class of owner grant or a trust-boundary design | ruling on procedure alone (Haiku with script-first pre-filtering is admitted for that) |
| reviewer | Sol (`gpt-5.6-sol`) | low for PR review, high for design ratification | final PR review bound to the exact head; adversarial verification | editing; sole authority on a contract claim |
| implementer | Sonnet | default | one packet, one worktree, one review subject | the canonical checkout; widening scope |
| recon | Luna (`gpt-5.6-luna`) | low | read-only shards, doctrine folds, evidence audits | editing |
| status | Haiku (Desktop chat session from `.claude-state/continuity/HAIKU-STATUS-PASTE.md`) | n/a | read heartbeat, receipts, PR list; report | adjudicate, mutate, dispatch, answer "what next" |

## Precedence against error-remediation.md

[error-remediation.md](error-remediation.md) governs a recoverable FAILURE inside an already
authorized packet: the hub records the failure, dispatches two or three read-only Luna shards for
root cause and regression evidence, takes Fable or Opus wisdom on conflicting evidence, and applies
the smallest supported fix itself, in the packet's own worktree, within the packet's allowed paths.
That stays as written. This document governs SELECTION and ADJUDICATION: which packet runs next,
who runs it, and any question of policy, ordering or trust boundary. Those use the Opus swarm.
"The hub dispatches; it does not do" means the hub never takes a packet's implementation onto
itself; it does not forbid the in-packet remediation fix that error-remediation.md assigns to the
hub. Luna shards and the Opus swarm are complementary: Luna gathers evidence at zero marginal
cost, Opus rules on it.

The lane table in `tools/coordination/Invoke-Lane.ps1` hard-codes Luna and Sol at high effort;
the per-call `-ReasoningEffort low` override is how the low-effort rows above are dispatched
today (receipts since 2026-09-06 show Luna low and Sol low runs). Changing the table defaults is
packet AUD-MODEL-ADAPTER, not this document.

## Rules that carry

- The hub dispatches; it does not do. A coordinator's own mutations are receipted like a lane's.
- Fallback: a Fable usage-limit refusal routes the same prompt to Opus high. The runner's refusal
  classifier detects the limit; the automatic re-route is packet LANE-FALLBACK-1 (add `max` to the
  effort set and a fallback map beside the lane table in `tools/coordination/Invoke-Lane.ps1`).
- Cross-family review is preferred, and required only for guard, merge, commit and
  ratification-path changes. The normative list of those paths is the hook's own fixed set,
  `CONTROL_HASHES_BASE` plus `EXECUTION_CONTROL_HASH_TABLE` in
  `tools/hooks/mlv-never-authorized.py`, which at 3e2b2220 enumerates eleven files:
  `tools/hooks/mlv-never-authorized.py`, `tools/hooks/test_registration_path_local.py`,
  `tools/repo_hygiene/test_mlv_never_authorized.py`, `tools/coordination/Invoke-Lane.ps1`,
  `Invoke-Workstream.ps1`, `Invoke-WorkstreamLoop.ps1`, `Compose-LanePrompt.ps1`,
  `demote-factory-bridge.ps1`, `set-required-checks.ps1`, `Test-ProductRatioGuard.ps1`,
  `freeze-factory-cards.py`; plus `closeout.config.json`, `.github/workflows/`, `CLAUDE.md`
  and `AGENTS.md` as operating-contract surfaces. Independence is four properties: author is not reviewer, adversarial
  instruction, independent access to ground truth, decorrelation by assignment. Same-family
  adversarial swarms are eligible reviews. Degraded mode when the cross-family key is dark: three
  same-family adversaries with distinct attack surfaces, a stamped `cross_family: UNAVAILABLE`
  token, and automatic re-review when the key returns. The `solVerdictPath` key in the control
  receipts stays frozen.
- Fan-out cap: total agent processes at most two per physical core; a three-agent frontier swarm
  does not run concurrently with a high-effort Sol lane.
- Before scaling Sonnet dispatch, land HOOK-FALSE-POSITIVE-1: the project hook's shell-text rule
  denied ordinary diagnostic commands and cost 14 of 27 editing runs on 2026-09-07.
