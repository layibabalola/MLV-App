# Test scaffold, runtime helper and investigation notes (detail)

Demoted verbatim from [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) under [docs/22-doc-fragmentation-policy.md](../docs/22-doc-fragmentation-policy.md). Headings are unchanged and remain the stable IDs referenced from the parent index.
## Implemented Test Scaffold
- Seed automated coverage now lives under `tests/`.
- CI entrypoint for that scaffold is `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.
- Keep the docs above synchronized with what is implemented now versus still planned next.
- On Windows, never launch `pipeline_tests.exe`, `console_tests.exe`, or other Qt-linked test executables from a bare shell, Explorer, or a direct `& .\...\*_tests.exe` command. They need the Qt and MinGW runtime DLLs on `PATH`; otherwise Windows shows modal missing-DLL popups such as `Qt6Core.dll`, `Qt6OpenGL.dll`, `Qt6Gui.dll`, `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`, `libstdc++-6.dll`, or `libwinpthread-1.dll` before the test can print a useful error.
- Use the repo wrapper for all local Windows Qt-linked tests. It prepares PATH, deploys missing runtime DLLs beside the selected test exe, and sets the process error mode to suppress Windows loader popups:
  - `pwsh.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\testing\run-windows-test.ps1 -Suite console -TestArgs '--gtest_filter=PlaybackQualityAutoSampler.*'`
  - `pwsh.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\testing\run-windows-test.ps1 -Suite pipeline -TestArgs '--gtest_filter=DualIsoPipeline.Phase4Bv3_AggressivePreviewAllowsHqMean23PreReconX4'`
- The Windows `console_tests` and `pipeline_tests` builds deploy Qt runtime/plugins with `windeployqt`, then copy MinGW/OpenMP runtime DLLs beside the exe through `tools\testing\deploy-windows-test-runtime.ps1`. If a modal missing-DLL popup appears, treat it as a workflow regression: stop using the bare command, rerun through `tools\testing\run-windows-test.ps1`, and update this note if the wrapper itself fails.
- When running a nested `pwsh.exe -Command` from an already-running PowerShell shell, do not put `$env:PATH=...` inside outer double quotes; the outer shell expands `$env:PATH` too early and can corrupt the child PATH. Prefer the current-shell form above, or single-quote the child command string.


## Active Investigation Notes

- The content-review gate validates a CLAIMED identity from the ledger; it does NOT authenticate that actor or session. Its blocked `expectedEntryFormat` includes the parsed heading grammar as well as the canonical range and exact `Range:`/`Verdict:` lines.
- `.claude/analysis/mlv-playback-investigation.md`
- `.claude/analysis/testing-strategy.md`
- `.claude/analysis/testing-scaffold-implementation.md`


## Runtime helper
- Use `.claude-state\\scripts\\run-mlvapp.ps1` for deterministic launches:
  - prepends the correct Qt and toolchain bins,
  - sets `QT_OPENGL=desktop`,
  - optionally runs `windeployqt` in-place,
  - and launches `MLVApp.exe` with supplied arguments.
