"""Tests for DUAL-VENUE-EVIDENCE-1: the venue half of the Dual-Venue Evidence framework.

WHAT IS PINNED (design: .claude-state/fleet-runs/dual-venue-design-20260930/DESIGN.md)
  * C1  the generator's DEFAULT output (bachelor / cuda) is byte-identical to master's generator;
        non-default venue / backend / Look Assist forcing are explicit, parseable variants.
  * C2  Invoke-VenueLeg.ps1 ALWAYS writes a typed receipt: VENUE_UNHEALTHY (leg NOT submitted),
        VENUE_HOST_MISMATCH, RETRACTED / UNRESOLVED from um-run, the typed refusals, and PASS.
        Roles come from venues.json; receipts are never overwritten.
  * A2  make-contact-sheet.py's side-by-side (cuda|cpu) mode pairs by frame index.
  * the leg-spec schema accepts the shipped legs and rejects a malformed one.

ROUND 2 (owner rule 2026-09-30, docs/playback-clip-length-rule.md) -- the CLIP-LENGTH CLASS:
  * a leg that PLAYS the app is addressed by a CONSENTED CLIP ID only (never a path), and the tracked
    fixtures (2 and 16 frames) are refused up front by master's own length gate, typed, before anything
    is generated or submitted -- no leg can loop, replay or play a short clip;
  * a leg whose VENUE lacks an owner-typed consent record for that clip id (venue-clip-consent.json,
    keyed by venue + clip id) refuses before submitting: consent on one venue never implies the other;
  * a receipt that says PASS or FAIL must carry the launcher's receipt-oracle verdict (source_advanced,
    required_source_frames, the run nonce, the clip id); without them it is INVALID, never PASS/FAIL.

The runner is executed for real (pwsh) with a STUB um-run.ps1 and a stub generator, so the receipt
rules run without hardware; the generator is executed for real for the byte-identity and variant tests.
Every rule has a MUTATION test: the guarding statement is taken out of a COPY of the runner and the
scenario must change, so a rule's test cannot pass with the rule removed.
Windows-only: the job generator and runner are PowerShell-on-Windows tools (the siblings gate the same way).

# The commit whose generator the DEFAULT emitted job must stay byte-identical to. UM-PRESENTMON-STOP-1 changed the
# default job on purpose (per-job PresentMon session name, clean named stop, one capture ceiling for every leg; r2:
# content-judged CSV tail repair, job-stop sufficiency arms, failed-terminate labelling, named terminate on failure
# paths); UM-PRESENTMON-STOP-2 changed it again on purpose (position-based job-stop sufficiency arms, alive-before-
# terminate / alive-before-kill exit attribution; r2: the capture-start bracket bounded by verified trace readiness,
# kill_fallback judged by .NET Kill's exit code; the probe lives in AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1), so this is that card's own
# generator commit (4c58c328: the r2 generator on the branch BEFORE the #231 merge, so it carries none of the DVE
# regions); it was 558143b1 (r2, before the probe moved into the module), 6567793196bf
# (UM-PRESENTMON-STOP-2 r1), abc10451ae2c (UM-PRESENTMON-STOP-1 r2), 8c19f442603c (r1) and before that
# PLAYBACK-CLIP-LENGTH-ENFORCE-4's merge (38ed2d8f96c2).
# DVE-PRESENTMON-EVIDENCE-1 r1 moves it again, on purpose: its item 1 (PresentMon's stdout/stderr redirected to files and published bounded, the CSV-existence record in
# presentmon-capture.json, the spawn-failure stream record) edits baseline lines of the default job IN PLACE (the Start-Process call, the two capture-json statements, the
# spawn-failure summary), which no bracketed region can express. The pin is therefore that card's own item-1 commit (2f91486c: the DVE-LEG-TERMINALS-1 generator plus item 1
# and nothing else); the card's remaining default-job text (item 2) is bracketed by its own DVE-PRESENTMON-EVIDENCE-1 sentinels and counted below. Item 1 is pinned by its own
# tests (test_dve_presentmon_evidence.py), not by byte identity; DVE-LEG-TERMINALS-1's four regions exist in the baseline too, so both sides are stripped of both families.
# UM-PRESENTMON-ORPHAN-SWEEP-1 r1 moves it again, honestly: the pin is now MASTER itself (a29a1ee4, the #233 merge this card branched from), not a card-internal commit. Every
# line the card adds to the default job (the pre-spawn orphan sweep, the post-Kill() session terminate in both stop paths, the lost-events scan and reason detail, the
# two capture-json fields, and the module helpers it splices in) is bracketed by its own UM-PRESENTMON-ORPHAN-SWEEP-1 sentinels and counted below, so NO in-place edit of
# master's text was needed: the DEFAULT job outside the brackets is byte-identical to master's, DVE-LEG-TERMINALS-1 and DVE-PRESENTMON-EVIDENCE-1 included (their regions
# exist in the baseline now, so both sides are stripped of all three families). The baseline moved from 2f91486c only because master's own DVE-PRESENTMON-EVIDENCE-1
# items 2-3 (merged since, bracketed) now sit in it.
# KEEPALIVE-FAILURE-PUBLISH-LAST-1 r2 moves it again, on purpose: that card REORDERS three baseline lines of the keep-alive body (Start-AttrCudaDisplayWakeKeepAlive,
# spliced into the default job verbatim): `$NudgeState.failureCount = ... + 1` moves from before to after the lastError / lastFailureUtc writes in the secure-screensaver,
# tick-error and catch branches. A reorder edits baseline lines IN PLACE, which no bracketed region can express (the baseline line would have to stay verbatim outside it),
# so the pin is that card's own generator commit (fc12fe8c: master e72dcdb6 plus the reorder and nothing else). That commit already carries every bracketed family, so the
# baseline counts below equal the pinned counts (they were 0 against a29a1ee4). The reorder is pinned by its own tests (test_playback_attr_3_cuda_behaviour.py), not by byte identity.
# CI-FLAKE-ATTR3-ROOT-GUARD-BEFORE-LOCK-READ-1 r2 moves it again, on purpose: that card MOVES the job's Assert-UnderMlvTmp definition and its Root/Work/Pub check from after the
# session-lock refusal (exit 30) to right after $Pub is named, before the first trace line, the display wake and the lock probe, so an outside -AgentRoot is refused (exit 1)
# whatever the host's console-lock state. A move edits baseline lines IN PLACE, which no bracketed region can express, so the pin is that card's own generator commit
# (cb795f9e: fork/master 6723cd5b plus the move and its comment, nothing else). It already carries every bracketed family, so the baseline counts below are unchanged. The move is
# pinned by its own test (test_the_root_guard_refuses_an_outside_root_before_the_session_lock_probe in test_playback_attr_3_cuda_behaviour.py), not by byte identity.
