"""One-shot, verbatim demotion of CLAUDE.md detail into claude/ children.

Implements section 4 of docs/22-doc-fragmentation-policy.md ("demote in place"):
CLAUDE.md keeps its exact path and becomes the index; detail moves to children in
the sibling directory named for the parent stem (CLAUDE -> claude/).

Guarantees, all machine-checked before anything is written:
  * every moved block is byte-identical to the source (SHA256 compared per block)
  * every substring asserted against CLAUDE.md by the closeout tooling baseline
    survives in the rewritten CLAUDE.md (otherwise closeout_tooling_stale fires)
  * no section is dropped: moved + retained == original section set

Run with --dry-run first. Writes nothing unless every check passes.
