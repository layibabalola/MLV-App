"""Validate the playback record of the mlvapp.perf-field-log.v1 NDJSON sink.

C2-TELEM-2: the sink already carried ``gpu_playback_recon_async_h2d_last_presented``
(the last frame's async-H2D fields only) with no session-wide rollup, no clock-identity
fields, and no byte-hash of the running executable (only ``machineFingerprint.build_sha``,
the git commit the build claims -- which says nothing about the bytes actually on disk).
``finishPlaybackSmokeTelemetry`` in platform/qt/MainWindow.cpp now also emits
``gpu_playback_recon_async_h2d_session_rollup`` (mean/max/sample-count per key, aggregated
across every presented frame, not just the last one), the ``playback_prep_region_clock_*``
fields, and ``machineFingerprint.executable_sha256``. This module is the oracle for that
contract; it has no prior version to extend because none of this was checked before.
