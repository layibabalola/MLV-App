# playback-attr-3-cuda-dll-job.ps1 -- GENERATOR (runs locally / in a lane; nothing here runs
# on Ultra-Magnus). Emits a self-contained <jobId>.job.ps1 plus a <jobId>-source.zip for the
# Ultra-Magnus file-drop agent (tools/profiling/ultra-magnus-agent.ps1 protocol: both files land
# in <agent root>\inbox; the agent runs the job; the job publishes into
# <agent root>\outbox\<jobId>.artifacts). The hub submits -- with tools/profiling/um-run.ps1 for
# the job script, which renames it to its own job id, which is why this job never reads its own
# file name: its jobId and therefore its source-zip name are BAKED IN.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (swarm ruling 2026-09-16,
# .claude-state/fleet-runs/swarm-attr3-buildhost-20260916T2150Z/SYNTHESIS.md). Bachelor has
# Visual Studio without the VC tools component (no cl.exe) and no CUDA toolkit at all; the
# compile-on-Bachelor job exited 5 at msvcDiscovery, as did the Aug 9 precedent. Ultra-Magnus
# has VC tools, CUDA 12.6 nvcc and an RTX 4090. So the CUDA DLL PAIR is built here and the
# Qt/MinGW exe is built on the board host
# (tools/profiling/bachelor/playback-attr-3-cuda-assemble.ps1), which consumes this job's
# published artifacts directory as its -DllPairDir.
#
# TARGET sm_86, NOT sm_89. The existing Ultra-Magnus compile jobs target sm_89 (Ada, the 4090's
# own architecture). The measurement host is Bachelor, whose GPU cannot run sm_89 cubins at all.
# -CudaArchitectures must therefore contain sm_86; the job re-proves it on the host with
# cuobjdump --list-elf against the built bytes, because a requested flag is not an emitted cubin.
#
# BOTH DLLs. The playback path under measurement loads igpu_recon_cuda.dll AND
# igpu_amaze_debayer_cuda.dll (MLVAPP_EXPERIMENTAL_GPU_AMAZE_DEBAYER=1 in the attribution job);
# shipping only the recon DLL produced a package that silently fell back.
#
# The tracked backend scripts are reused verbatim -- tools/gpu/backend/build-backend-dll.ps1 and
# tools/gpu/backend/amaze-debayer-dll.ps1, from the EXTRACTED source archive, so the build
# recipe is the one committed at -SourceCommit and not a copy that can drift.
#
# SOURCE ARCHIVE BINDING (sol, PR #133 r2, BLOCKER). Everything above is a claim about the
# EXTRACTED source, and the archive travels to Ultra-Magnus as an ordinary inbox side-file. Its
# lowercase sha256 is therefore computed here and BAKED IN, and the job verifies the arriving
# bytes against it -- and the commit id git stamps into the zip comment against -SourceCommit --
# BEFORE Expand-Archive runs, failing closed at exit 8. Without that, altered or stale source
# would produce DLLs whose manifest still claims sourceCommit. The verified sha is recorded as
# dll-pair-manifest.json's sourceArchiveSha256 so the claim is auditable downstream.
# The verification functions are embedded VERBATIM from
# tools/profiling/bachelor/AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1 (a job on a host with no checkout cannot
# Import-Module), which is how the test suite exercises the same code the job runs.
# `<jobId>.job.ps1 -VerifyOnly` runs exactly that prefix and exits, writing nothing.
#
# NO FOOTAGE. This job compiles source and inspects binaries. It never opens, names, globs or
# resolves a media file, and nothing it emits does either.
