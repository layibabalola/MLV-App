.SYNOPSIS
    Produce a REFERENCE FRAME CANDIDATE: one presented frame plus the full identity of what
    produced it. Emits reference-frame-candidate.v1. It does NOT promote anything.

.DESCRIPTION
    WHY THIS EXISTS.
    tools/gates/output-budget.json has carried
        "baseline": { "status": "pending_instrumented_known_good_bridge",
                      "commit": null, "executableSha256": null, "artifact": null }
    since 2026-08-18. output_budget.py's own validator says a promoted baseline needs
    status "reviewed_instrumented_known_good" plus a 40-hex commit, a 64-hex executableSha256
    and a nonempty artifact identifier. The gate machinery was built and never bound - the
    missing piece is the BRIDGE named in that status string, which is this script.

    WHAT IT DELIBERATELY WILL NOT DO.
    It never writes "reviewed_instrumented_known_good". The contract's own word is REVIEWED, and
    an actor that promotes its own capture to reviewed-known-good has granted itself the review.
    This emits status "candidate-unreviewed" and stops. A reviewer promotes it, or nobody does.

    WHY A CAPTURE WITHOUT IDENTITY IS WORTHLESS.
    On 2026-09-03 a single frame with no reference produced a confident "blue cast regression"
    verdict that a reference arm then refuted - the older build measured MARGINALLY BLUER on the
    same clip. A frame is evidence only when you can say exactly which binary, which clip, and
    which settings produced it, so the manifest carries all three by HASH, not by name.

.NOTES
    ASCII-only by project convention. Run ON the bench that has the GPU and the clips.
    NEVER screen-capture the bench: this uses the app's OWN --screenshot-output, because the
    bench is a machine its owner uses interactively and a desktop grab captures their screen,
    not the application. (Rule earned the hard way, 2026-09-03.)

    # moving in lockstep - an uncontrolled measurement wearing decimal places.
    # --presented-frames stops after exactly N FRESH presented frames ("--seconds remains a

    # candidate differed by mean|px| 28 across 99.92% of pixels, which is a different-frame
