# attr3-footage-stage.ps1 -- the ONE tracked, id-only entry point that stages an owner-consented
# clip onto Bachelor, fully automated: resolve -> verify the source on THIS host -> transfer to
# the agent share -> emit and submit a Bachelor job that places the bytes at the spec path.
# ATTR3-FOOTAGE-STAGE-1.
#
# WHAT RUNS WHERE. Steps 1-3 below run ON THIS HOST (Virtual-Ten): resolving the clip, verifying
# every source part's bytes, and copying them to the agent share under neutral, index-derived
# names (tools/profiling/bachelor/AttrCudaOwnerFootage.psm1's Send-AttrCudaOwnerFootagePartTo-
# Staging). Step 4 builds a job (tools/profiling/bachelor/Attr3FootageStageJob.psm1) and submits
# it through tools/profiling/um-run.ps1, which is the ONLY tracked writer of the agent's inbox --
# step 4's own job then runs on Bachelor, with no checkout and no module path of its own, and does
# the actual placement at the spec path. This script never places a file at that path itself.
#
# THE RESOLVER CHILD PROCESS IS THE ONLY WAY THIS SCRIPT OBTAINS PARTS. There is no parameter
# that accepts a caller-typed path for any part, mirroring attr3-footage-presence-job.ps1's own
# contract: tools/gates/resolve_consented_clip.py alone proves the frozen spec agrees with the
# hook's frozen consent table for -ClipId, and only its --emit-json output -- read by this
# process, never printed -- ever names a part's real path.
#
# NO PATH EVER REACHES THIS SCRIPT'S OWN OUTPUT. Every Write-Output line below names the clip id,
# a part index, a part's staging/verification STATUS TOKEN, or a job id -- never a footage path,
# source or target. The resolver's own stdout (captured only to fold into a refusal message) is
# already path-free by contract (its CLI never prints a part path); Send-AttrCudaOwnerFootagePart-
# ToStaging's and um-run.ps1's own thrown/returned text carry the same guarantee.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File tools\profiling\bachelor\attr3-footage-stage.ps1 -ClipId M16-1243
# Exits 0 with RESULT=FOOTAGE_STAGED when Bachelor now holds every part at its spec path; exits 1
# with RESULT=FOOTAGE_STAGE_REFUSED (or an ATTR3_FOOTAGE_STAGE_* refusal token) on an ordinary,
# safely-retryable failure; exits 2 with RESULT=FOOTAGE_STAGE_UNRESOLVED when um-run.ps1 itself
# stopped waiting on the placement submission without proof the agent is either done with it or
# dead (ATTR3-FOOTAGE-STAGE-SUBMIT-RETRY-1 round 11) -- NOT a failure and NOT safely retryable on
# this evidence alone: the agent may still be running the job and may still publish a receipt for
# it after this process has already exited. This attempt's own already-staged share-side parts are
# LEFT IN PLACE on UNRESOLVED (RESIDUE=RETAINED, round 12) -- never deleted while the agent may
# still be reading them. Idempotent: a clip already fully present on Bachelor at
# its spec path transfers nothing new and still reports FOOTAGE_STAGED (every part lands
# ALREADY_PRESENT).

    slot on the outer catch already exists for an unanticipated .NET exception; this reuses that

    generic timeout failure at all -- every non-receipt outcome it can throw is now RETRACTED or

    Neither is a failure this script may treat as one: RETRACTED is a clean refusal (the job never
    ran), and UNRESOLVED means the agent may still own the job and its receipt may still land
    later -- this script's own callers must not retry on UNRESOLVED as if it were an ordinary,
