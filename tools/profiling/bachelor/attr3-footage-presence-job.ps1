# attr3-footage-presence-job.ps1 -- GENERATOR (runs locally; nothing here runs on Bachelor and
# nothing here is submitted to Bachelor -- the hub does both). Emits a job that answers exactly
# one question, safely, on the measurement host: does Bachelor already hold owner-consented clip
# <id>, byte-exact, at the path the frozen spec names for it (ATTR3-FOOTAGE-BIND-1, PR-A).
#
# WHY A SEPARATE GENERATOR, NOT A FOURTH ARTIFACT IN A STAGE JOB. This is a PROBE, not a publish
# job: it copies nothing, renames nothing and touches no cache. It exists so the hub can learn
# "is the corpus already there" BEFORE any playback attempt, without ever putting a real footage
# path in a command, a log, or this generator's own stdout.
#
# WHAT IS BAKED AND WHAT IS CHECKED. This generator calls tools/gates/resolve_consented_clip.py
# as a CHILD PROCESS with --emit-json into a private temp file: the resolver alone proves that
# the frozen spec's parts for this clip id (length, sha256, and the hook's own norm() of the
# path) agree with the hook's frozen consent table. This generator then reads that temp file
# IN-PROCESS, deletes it, and hands the resolved parts to
# Attr3FootagePresenceJob.psm1's New-Attr3FootagePresenceJob, which bakes each part's path as
# BASE64 of its UTF-8 bytes (never an interpolated literal -- see that module's header) plus its
# length and sha256 into the emitted job. The emitted job, on Bachelor, re-checks each part
# against the LIVE filesystem: existence, length, and a streaming sha256 -- never trusting that
# "the resolver approved it" means the bytes are still there.
#
# THE RESOLVER CHILD PROCESS IS THE ONLY WAY THIS GENERATOR OBTAINS PARTS (round 2, defect 3).
# There used to be a public -InjectResolvedPartsJsonPathForTests parameter that let ANY caller
# skip the resolver and hand this generator synthetic parts directly -- and with it, skip the
# resolver's cross-check against the hook's frozen consent table. That parameter is gone. Tests
# that need synthetic parts now import Attr3FootagePresenceJob.psm1 directly and call
# New-Attr3FootagePresenceJob themselves; that module never touches git, the spec, or the
# consent table, so calling it is not a way to forge a presence job for a real clip id -- it only
# ever runs against parts a test fabricated itself.
#
# NO PATH EVER REACHES THIS GENERATOR'S OWN OUTPUT. The resolver's own stdout (captured here only
# to fold into a refusal message) is already path-free by contract (its CLI never prints a part
# path). This generator's own Write-Output lines name the clip id, the part count and the local
# job file path it just wrote -- never a footage path.
#
# NO PUBLISH, NO PLAYBACK. The emitted job opens nothing for playback, deploys nothing, and writes
# nothing to disk except its own stdout: a per-part PASS/MISSING/UNREADABLE/LENGTH_MISMATCH/
# SHA256_MISMATCH line, one RESULT= line, and one path-free JSON summary line.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File tools\profiling\bachelor\attr3-footage-presence-job.ps1 `
#       -ClipId M16-1243 -OutDir <staging-dir>
# then submit the emitted <jobId>.job.ps1 to Bachelor the same way any other job in this route is
# submitted -- it needs no side file at all; the resolved parts travel inside the job.
