# ATTR3-ADMIT-CONTENT-PIN-1 -- check/use window table (round 2g, corrected round 2h)

Round 2g responded to round 2f's two independent keys (`sol`, `fable`), both CHANGES_REQUESTED,
both converging on the same structural finding: the table itself carried the defect it exists to
prevent -- a row marked CLOSED that only narrowed, and a window missing entirely. That round
committed the table to the tracked tree for the first time, rather than living only in
round-scoped review evidence, specifically so it survives independently of any single round's
turn budget.

Round 2h responds to round 2g's own two keys (`sol`, `fable`), again both CHANGES_REQUESTED,
again converging independently: the tally round 2g computed re-introduced the exact defect the
table exists to prevent, this time in the ARITHMETIC rather than in a single row's prose (Row G
counted under CLOSED while its own status line read OPEN); a whole window (the agent's own
enumerate-then-execute step) was never enumerated; and two of round 2g's own fixes shipped
without a falsifying test. Round 2h's fixes are enumerated in each affected row/section below
and are not restated here.

**Rule this table follows (round-2g ruling, extended round 2h, binding going forward): a row is
CLOSED only when the window is CLOSED, not narrowed. A mechanism is named as what it is (a
handle, an allowlist, a literal-spelling match) plus its enumerated escape hatches. Enlarging a
list and re-claiming closure is not accepted as a fix. The rule binds the TALLY as hard as the
row text: a row or token is counted exactly ONCE, by its own stated Status, never re-derived or
re-described in the tally section itself; and a residual named in a row's prose but not reflected
in that row's own Status line (an untested-but-inspected-correct code path, i.e. a coverage gap)
is never promoted into a second, separate OPEN line item in the tally -- it stays exactly where
it is named, visible to a reader of that row, and is tracked in the dedicated "Known coverage
gaps" list below the tally, which does not feed the CLOSED/OPEN count.**

**Line-number citation convention (round 2h, item 7):** this table previously cited PRE-round-2g
line numbers for lines round 2g itself had just moved (`AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1:465` for a call
round 2g moved to line 482; `:518-527` for a call it moved to `:541-549`) -- a table meant to
outlive rounds cannot cite a ref it does not name. Citations into `AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1` below
are by function name and the anchoring code's own literal text, which does not drift when
unrelated lines are inserted elsewhere in the file. Citations into `attr3-stage-fixture-job.ps1`
(Rows E and F) are still given as line numbers, because that file is untouched this round and
those numbers are accurate as of this round's HEAD -- but they carry the same staleness risk the
day that file next changes, and are equally in scope for the symbol-name treatment then.

**Walk boundary (round 2h, item 3 -- stated explicitly for the first time; the table's four prior
rounds never declared this and so could not be checked for completeness by anyone, including
their own authors):** this table walks the PRODUCER side only, from admission through to the
final write of an artifact this round considers "published" -- `Get-UmRunFixtureAdmission` ->
`Test-UmRunFixtureContentPin` -> `Assert-AttrCudaFixtureCommittedBytes` (admission) ->
`Invoke-UmRunDrop`'s pre-copy re-hash, share-side `.sidepart` hash-then-rename, and job-file
hash-then-rename (placement onto the agent's SMB share) -> `attr3-stage-fixture-job.ps1`'s
generator-time bake AND the emitted job's own arrival-hash and cache-`.partial` hash-then-rename
(generator + emitted-job execution) -> `ultra-magnus-agent.ps1`'s inbox enumeration and execution
of that placed job file (round 2h, new -- see Row H). **It stops at the moment a job's own
`Write-Output`/exit-code result is produced; it does NOT walk the CONSUMING side** --
`playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1`'s own re-verification of the cache it reads from (mentioned only
as a downstream mitigation in Row F, never as its own row), the outbox `.result.json`
publication back to the VM, or anything the VM itself does with a result once received. That
consuming-side path is a materially different trust boundary (result data flowing back off the
measurement host, rather than fixture/job bytes flowing onto it) and was judged out of this
card's scope; it is named here as unexamined, not as closed, and not as absent from the codebase.

## Row A -- admission's internal read: git-blob drift compare + SHA256 pin derivation

- **Mechanism:** `Assert-AttrCudaFixtureCommittedBytes` opens the fixture ONCE via
  `[IO.File]::Open($full, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read)` -- no Write, no Delete
  share -- reads it into one buffer, and derives both the git-blob drift compare and the returned
  SHA256 pin from that same buffer.
- **Escape hatches:** none identified. `FileShare.Read` alone (no Delete) denies both a concurrent
  write AND a concurrent rename/delete of this exact path for the handle's whole lifetime.
- **Status: CLOSED.** Round 2d closed this structurally (one buffer, one handle). Round 2e added
  `test_the_source_derives_both_hashes_from_one_read_buffer` and
  `test_a_deny_write_handle_blocks_a_concurrent_writer_for_its_whole_lifetime`, proving the
  mechanism rather than merely asserting it.
- **Residual (coverage gap, not a defect):** `Get-AttrCudaGitBlobHashFromBytes`'s
  `Process.Start`/stream-I/O catch (guards a git-binary-vanishes-mid-launch failure) has no
  dedicated test for that specific catch path.

## Row B -- admission's returned pin -> local re-hash immediately before the share copy

- **Mechanism:** `Invoke-UmRunDrop` re-hashes `$SourcePath` (SHA256, independent read) immediately
  before calling `$Copier`, and binds the result back to admission's pinned SHA256; mismatch
  throws `UMRUN_FIXTURE_CONTENT_PIN_RACE`.
- **Escape hatches:** none within this window itself -- a swap strictly BETWEEN admission
  returning and this re-hash is exactly what the bind-back catches (fail-closed, not fail-silent).
- **Status: CLOSED**, closed in round 2 (`fe6be215`), unchanged in logic since.

## Row C -- share-side `.sidepart`: round-trip hash verification -> rename

- **Mechanism:** `$Copier` copies the source to `$part`. A handle is then opened
  `[IO.File]::Open($part, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read -bor FileShare.Delete)`
  -- denies Write share; PERMITS Delete share (so the rename below can still succeed while the
  handle stays open). SHA256 is computed over that handle and compared to `$localSha`; on match,
  `Move-Item -LiteralPath $part -Destination $destination` is called while the SAME handle is
  still open (disposed only in the outer `finally`).
- **Escape hatch (round-2g finding, sol/fable, both keys independently): `FileShare.Delete` grants
  exactly what its name says.** Another process can delete `$part`'s directory entry (freeing the
  name) and a third process can create a brand-new file at the identical pathname, all while this
  handle is open -- the handle's Read/Write denial says nothing about the Delete/rename right it
  explicitly grants. `Move-Item` below resolves `$part` by PATHNAME at rename time, not by this
  handle's identity, so it would publish whatever now occupies that path. The new
  `test_a_write_attempt_between_the_share_hash_and_the_rename_is_denied` test proves only the
  narrower "an in-place WriteAllBytes is denied" property (confirmed by inspection: the hook does
  `[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($p, ...)`, not a delete-then-recreate) -- it does not and cannot
  discriminate this pathname-identity race, because the deny-write handle does not defend against
  it.
- **Status: OPEN, corrected from round 2f's table (which recorded this CLOSED).** What remains:
  publishing by handle identity (e.g. a rename issued against the open handle itself, which
  requires native interop -- .NET has no managed API for a rename-by-handle) rather than by
  reopening the pathname at `Move-Item` time. Not fixed in round 2g: the correct fix is a native
  `FILE_RENAME_INFO`-via-handle call, which is a materially larger, harder-to-verify change than
  this round's scope; recording the honest OPEN state was judged the safer choice per this round's
  own ruling than shipping an unverified native-interop rename under time pressure.
- **Round 2g change:** applied the IDENTICAL mechanism (with the identical residual, documented
  above) to the job file's own temporary copy, which previously had NO verification at all --
  see the new Row G below.

## Row D -- generator bake: admission pin reused, no second independent read

- **Mechanism:** `attr3-stage-fixture-job.ps1` reuses `Get-UmRunFixtureAdmission`'s pinned SHA256
  instead of an independent second read; `-PostAdmissionHook` fires in the admission-return gap;
  mismatch throws `ATTR3_FIXTURE_CONTENT_PIN_RACE`.
- **Status: CLOSED**, closed in round 2 (`fe6be215`), unchanged in logic since. Round 2e only
  relocated the two tests exercising this race into a disposable throwaway repository (test
  hygiene, not a coverage or logic change).

## Row E -- emitted job: inbox arrival hash vs. baked pin

- **Mechanism:** the job the generator emits (runs on the measurement host, no repo checkout) reads
  the side-file that arrived in the inbox once (`$arrivedSha = Get-ShaLower $side`,
  `attr3-stage-fixture-job.ps1:211`) and compares it to `$FixtureSha256`, the value the generator
  baked into the template at generation time. Mismatch calls `Complete-Failed` (exit 4), fail-closed.
- **Escape hatches:** none within this window -- this is a single read compared to a value fixed
  before the job was ever written to disk; nothing after this read but before publication reuses
  the arrival read itself (see Row F for what happens to the bytes next).
- **Status: CLOSED.** Newly given its own row in round 2g; previously undocumented in the table
  (round-2f's table stopped at the generator bake, Row D).

## Row F -- emitted job: cache `.partial` hash-then-rename (round-2g finding, both keys)

- **Mechanism:** `Publish-AttrCudaFileCopy -Source $side -Destination $partialPath`
  (`attr3-stage-fixture-job.ps1:246`) copies the arrived side-file into the cache as `<name>.partial`
  using a plain `Copy-Item`, opening and closing its own handle. The very next statement,
  `(Get-ShaLower $partialPath) -ne $FixtureSha256` (`:247`), opens ANOTHER independent handle to
  hash it. On match, `Publish-AttrCudaFileMoveNonOverwriting -Source $partialPath -Destination
  $cachePath` (`:255`) calls `[IO.File]::Move($partialPath, $cachePath, $false)`, a THIRD,
  completely independent handle. Three separate handles on the same mutable path -- this is
  precisely the pre-round-2e shape Row C used to have (hash, close, rename, on an unheld path),
  not the "handle spans hash-to-rename" shape Row C (and now Row G) apply, so it does not even
  reach Row C's residual level of protection; nothing here denies a concurrent writer at any point.
- **This is the window sol's and fable's round-2f reports both named as missing from the table**
  (the round-2f prompt explicitly asked for "the job arrival hash" leg, which the table's declared
  path never reached).
- **Two acceptance branches omitted from round 2g's telling (sol, round 2h finding), both of
  which hash this same mutable `$cachePath` and then report SUCCESS without ever holding its
  identity across the report:**
  - **Existing-cache branch** (`if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $cachePath -PathType Leaf) { if
    ((Get-ShaLower $cachePath) -eq $FixtureSha256) { Complete-AlreadyStaged ... } }`, near the top
    of the staging job, before the copy-to-`.partial` path above is ever reached): if the cache
    already holds a file matching `$FixtureSha256`, the job hashes it once, then calls
    `Complete-AlreadyStaged`, which publishes `result.json` naming `$cachePath` and
    `$FixtureSha256` together as a verified pair -- with the file handle from the hash already
    closed. Nothing holds `$cachePath` between that hash and the moment the published result is
    read by anything downstream; a swap in that gap is not this row's Row-C/G shape (no rename is
    even involved here), but it is the identical "hash a mutable path, then use the path's name
    as if the hash still describes it" defect this row exists to name.
  - **Lost-publish-race branch** (the `catch` after `Publish-AttrCudaFileMoveNonOverwriting`
    fails because a concurrent publisher already occupies `$cachePath`): the job re-hashes
    `$cachePath`, and on a match calls the SAME `Complete-AlreadyStaged` as the branch above, on
    the theory that the concurrent publisher finished the identical fixture. Same shape, same
    absence of a held handle between the hash and the report.
  - Neither branch is fixed in round 2h -- they are recorded here for the first time, both OPEN,
    for the same reason as the mechanism above: closing either needs the same not-yet-existing
    "hash-then-hold" primitive, and it was already judged out of this round's scope for the
    mechanism they share.
- **Mitigation, not closure (both keys agree):** the downstream consumer,
  `playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1`, re-authenticates the cached clip against its own `-FixtureSha256`
  parameter and fails closed at `FIXTURE_CONTENT_MISMATCH` before attribution runs -- so a swap
  landing in this window is caught before it can influence an attribution result. That bounds
  practical impact; it does not close this window, which is this table's job to enumerate.
- **Status: OPEN.** Not fixed in round 2g: closing it to Row C/G's level (a held handle spanning
  hash-to-rename) requires a new shared helper in `AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1` (there is no existing
  "hash-then-move-under-one-handle" helper; `Publish-AttrCudaFileMoveNonOverwriting` is a generic,
  multiply-used helper whose contract would need to change for every caller, or a new sibling
  function added and re-embedded into the job template) -- judged out of this round's scope under
  its own scope-discipline directive. Recorded OPEN rather than silently narrowed.

## Row G -- job-file placement: `.job.tmp` hash-then-rename (round-2g fix, item 5)

- **Mechanism, before this round:** `Invoke-UmRunDrop` copied `$ScriptPath` to `$tmp` and called
  `Move-Item -LiteralPath $tmp -Destination $final` with **no verification of any kind** --
  contradicting the module's own header invariant (which claimed every share-side temporary is
  re-read and verified before its rename). This was the single executable artifact placed into the
  inbox, placed unverified.
- **Mechanism, after this round:** the identical mechanism Row C uses -- one handle, opened
  `FileShare.Read -bor FileShare.Delete` (deny-write, permit-delete), spans the round-trip SHA256
  hash and the `Move-Item` rename. Mismatch throws the new token `UMRUN_JOB_VERIFY_FAILED`.
- **Escape hatch:** identical to Row C's -- `FileShare.Delete` permits a delete-and-recreate at
  `$tmp`'s pathname while the handle is held, and `Move-Item` resolves that pathname, not the
  handle's identity.
- **Status: OPEN, but materially improved from round 2f's "no verification at all."** Closing the
  residual requires the same native-interop rename-by-handle work named as out of scope for Row C;
  applying it here inherits, rather than introduces, that limitation.
- **Falsifier added round 2h (item 5):** `test_job_bytes_altered_on_the_share_are_refused_and_the_job_is_not_placed`
  (`test_um_run_sidefiles.py`) drives a `$Copier` that corrupts `$tmp` after the copy; asserts
  `UMRUN_JOB_VERIFY_FAILED` is thrown and the corrupted job never reaches `inbox\demo.job.ps1`.
  Manually verified to go RED (silent `NO_THROW`, corrupted job placed unnoticed) against a
  scratch copy of the module with this round's mechanism reverted to the pre-round-2g shape.

## Row H -- job execution: inbox enumeration -> `Start-Process` (round-2h finding, item 2)

- **Mechanism:** `ultra-magnus-agent.ps1`'s poll loop lists `*.job.ps1` in the inbox
  (`Get-ChildItem $inbox -Filter *.job.ps1 -File`), then for each result calls `Start-Process
  -FilePath $psExe -ArgumentList @(..., "-File", $jobPathArgument) ...` against that same
  `FileInfo`'s `.FullName`. Between the listing and the moment the child `pwsh`/`powershell`
  process actually opens and reads that path to execute it, nothing in this file holds any
  handle on it at all -- not even the deny-write handle Row C/F/G use elsewhere in this table.
  Row G's hash-then-rename verification runs entirely at PLACEMENT time, on the far side of the
  SMB share; nothing re-authenticates the file's content at EXECUTION time, an arbitrarily later
  moment (bounded only by `$PollSeconds` and however long the job sits queued behind earlier
  jobs in the same poll pass).
- **This is the window the hub named as missing entirely: the tracked table never mentioned
  `ultra-magnus-agent.ps1` once.** Every other row in this table ends at a file landing on the
  share, verified at the moment it landed; this is the only row about what happens to that file
  between landing and running.
- **Escape hatches:** the whole window, end to end -- the job pathname is mutable for its entire
  residence in the inbox, and `Start-Process`/`-File` resolves it by pathname at whatever moment
  the child process gets around to opening it, exactly like `Move-Item` resolves `$part`/`$tmp` by
  pathname in Row C/G. A write to that pathname any time after Row G's verification and before
  the child's own read -- by any process capable of writing to the share, not necessarily an
  adversarial one; a second submitter reusing a name, a retry, a stray script -- runs unverified.
  No upstream check bounds this: Row G proves the bytes were correct AT PLACEMENT, which is
  precisely what this window is positioned after.
- **Status: OPEN. Not fixed in round 2h** -- closing it needs a new provenance channel this
  protocol does not currently have (the agent has no expected hash to check the job against at
  execution time; Row G's verification is consumed entirely at placement and produces no artifact
  the agent could re-check later, unlike, e.g., a hash sidecar written alongside the job and
  re-read immediately before `Start-Process`). Adding that channel is a two-sided protocol change
  (`Invoke-UmRunDrop` plus `ultra-magnus-agent.ps1`) of comparable size to round 2g's Row G fix,
  and was judged out of this round's scope under the same scope-discipline directive Row F and
  Row C's own residuals were judged under. Recorded OPEN, not CLOSED on the strength of Row G's
  placement-time check, which is exactly the upstream-check reasoning this item warned against.

## Round-2e/2g/2h classification theme (cross-cutting, not a single check/use window)

Splitting "could not determine admissibility" (environmental/operational failure) from "definite
refusal" (an evidenced verdict about the fixture's bytes):

| Token | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `ATTR3_FIXTURE_HEAD_LOOKUP_UNAVAILABLE` | `git rev-parse "HEAD:$relative"` inside `Assert-AttrCudaFixtureCommittedBytes` (`AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1`) fails for a reason other than genuine non-commitment | CLOSED, tested (round 2e) |
| `UMRUN_FIXTURE_CONTENT_PIN_UNAVAILABLE` | `Import-Module` of a present-but-broken bachelor module | CLOSED, tested (round 2e) |
| `UMRUN_FIXTURE_ADMISSION_PATH_RESOLUTION_UNAVAILABLE` | `Get-Item`/`ResolveLinkTarget` raw throw in `Get-UmRunFixtureAdmission` | **OPEN -- coverage gap** (catch exists, no test drives the specific TOCTOU throw path) |
| `UMRUN_SIDEFILE_ADMISSION_INDETERMINATE` / `ATTR3_FIXTURE_ADMISSION_INDETERMINATE` | side-file and generator admission-refusal callers branch on `.Indeterminate` | CLOSED, tested |
| `ATTR3_FIXTURE_GIT_UNAVAILABLE` (repository-discovery leg) | **round-2g fix, round-2h anchor tightening:** `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` inside `Assert-AttrCudaFixtureCommittedBytes` (`AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1`) used to discard stderr (`2>$null`) and fold EVERY failure -- dubious ownership, corrupted config, I/O error -- into the definite `ATTR3_FIXTURE_NOT_IN_A_REPO`. Now inspects stderr the same way the HEAD:<path> lookup already did: only git's own `fatal: not a git repository` text (round 2h: anchored to the `fatal: ` prefix git itself always emits ahead of it, narrowing the round-2g match, which was a bare, unanchored `not a git repository` substring test -- the same shape as the HEAD:<path> lookup's own known-open `invalid object name` edge below) is the definite refusal; everything else is `ATTR3_FIXTURE_GIT_UNAVAILABLE` (already a registered indeterminate token) | **CLOSED, round 2g, anchor tightened round 2h. Falsifier added round 2h:** `test_a_corrupted_repo_config_is_indeterminate_not_not_in_a_repo` (`test_playback_attr_3_cuda_behaviour.py`) corrupts `.git/config` so `--show-toplevel` fails with git's own `fatal: bad config line` text and asserts `ATTR3_FIXTURE_GIT_UNAVAILABLE`, not `ATTR3_FIXTURE_NOT_IN_A_REPO`. Manually verified to go RED (throws `ATTR3_FIXTURE_NOT_IN_A_REPO`) against a scratch copy of the module with this round's stderr inspection reverted. |
| the classification mechanism itself | `UmRunDrop.psm1`'s `$UmRunIndeterminateAdmissionTokens` | **OPEN -- named honestly, round 2g/2h: this is a TOKEN ALLOWLIST over a closed, documented set of throw sites, not an exhaustive classification.** It is only as complete as every throw site actually using one of its tokens. Round 2g found and fixed one gap where a throw site used a definite token it should not have (the show-toplevel leg above). Three narrower, prose-only escape hatches remain and are named in `Assert-AttrCudaFixtureCommittedBytes`'s docstring rather than fixed: an unanchored `invalid object name` stderr match; the show-toplevel `fatal: not a git repository` match, round-2h-narrowed but still a substring match rather than a fully anchored one; and a large-fixture OOM that surfaces as a raw untokened exception instead of `ATTR3_FIXTURE_CONTENT_PIN_UNBINDABLE`. Carrying THREE live escape hatches, this row is OPEN as a whole even though two of the three tokens it governs are individually CLOSED above -- the allowlist mechanism and the tokens it classifies are tracked separately in this tally (see below). |

## Known-item accounting (round-2g completion of item 4)

- **`.gitattributes` clean-filter preimage -- proper mechanism row (was tally-only before this round).**
  `Get-AttrCudaGitBlobHashFromBytes` reproduces git's blob hash by piping the in-memory buffer to
  `git hash-object --stdin --path <RelativePath>`, which selects clean filters (`.gitattributes`
  `filter=`/`clean=` drivers, `core.autocrlf`) by the PATH given to `--path`, not by re-reading the
  file itself. **Known limitation, pre-existing, not investigated further this round:** an external
  filter driver whose behaviour depends on something other than piped byte content (e.g. reading
  the actual on-disk file path itself, or environment/working-directory state a real checkout
  provides that stdin does not) could disagree with what `git hash-object <path>` would compute by
  reading the file directly. No fixture in this repository currently exercises a custom external
  clean filter, so this is undefended and untested, not merely undocumented. **Status: OPEN,
  pre-existing, out of this round's scope.**
- **`core.autocrlf` in `_make_fixture_repo` -- accounted for, not a fix to the item above.**
  `test_playback_attr_3_cuda_behaviour.py`'s `_make_fixture_repo` (and the two
  `test_um_run_sidefiles.py` setUps plus `StageFixtureJobRaceTests`) pin `core.autocrlf=true`
  locally in the throwaway fixture repo. This is TEST DETERMINISM, not a code fix: it guarantees
  the suite's CRLF-normalisation fixture actually exercises git's clean-filter path on every host,
  regardless of the host's own global `core.autocrlf`, so the round-2d self-caught defect (a naive
  raw-byte SHA1 that ignored git's filters) stays caught by CI on any machine. It does not touch,
  and is not a disposition on, the clean-filter preimage gap named above -- that gap is about an
  UNTESTED kind of filter (external driver), not about whether autocrlf itself is exercised.
  **Status: test-hygiene item, CLOSED as test hygiene; does not change the disposition of the
  clean-filter preimage row above.**

## Tally

**Counting convention (round 2h, item 1 -- stated explicitly for the first time):** each primary
row (A-H) and each classification-table token/mechanism row is counted exactly ONCE, by its own
stated Status line -- never re-described or re-derived in this section. A residual named in a
row's own prose that is NOT reflected in that row's Status line (an inspected-correct-but-untested
code path, i.e. a coverage gap) is not a second, separate OPEN entry here; it lives only in
"Known coverage gaps" below, which this count explicitly excludes. This is the direct fix for
round 2g's own tally defect: round 2g's CLOSED list named Row G despite Row G's own Status line
reading "OPEN, but materially improved" one screen above it -- the tally inflating a row's
disposition past what its own prose claimed, the same shape this table exists to catch, just
moved from a single row's text into the arithmetic that summarizes all of them.

- **CLOSED (8):** Row A, Row B, Row D, Row E (4 primary rows); `ATTR3_FIXTURE_HEAD_LOOKUP_UNAVAILABLE`,
  `UMRUN_FIXTURE_CONTENT_PIN_UNAVAILABLE`, the indeterminate-branching callers, and the
  `ATTR3_FIXTURE_GIT_UNAVAILABLE` show-toplevel fix (4 classification-table rows).
- **OPEN (7):** Row C, Row F, Row G, Row H (4 primary rows -- Row G's own Status line has read
  OPEN since the sentence was first written in round 2g; round 2g's tally miscounted it as
  CLOSED, corrected here); the `UMRUN_FIXTURE_ADMISSION_PATH_RESOLUTION_UNAVAILABLE` token and
  the classification allowlist mechanism itself, both by their own stated Status (2
  classification-table rows); the pre-existing clean-filter preimage gap (1, tracked under
  "Known-item accounting" above).
- **Not tallied (test-hygiene, neither a window nor a gap):** the `core.autocrlf` fixture-repo
  pinning, tracked under "Known-item accounting" above.
- **Total: 8 CLOSED / 7 OPEN, 15 tallied.** Lower than round 2g's stated headline (9 CLOSED / 8
  OPEN) because Row G is no longer counted twice under two different verdicts (CLOSED in the
  headline list, its residual separately named under OPEN) -- it is one row, tallied once, at the
  verdict its own Status line has stated since round 2g.

## Known coverage gaps (not tallied; follow-up, not a defect)

Untested-but-inspected-correct code paths named in a row's own prose without appearing in that
row's Status line. Per the counting convention above, these never change a row's CLOSED/OPEN
disposition and are not counted in the tally; they are follow-up items for a future round's
test-writing budget, listed here so they stay visible rather than buried inside a CLOSED row's
paragraph.

- **Row A:** `Get-AttrCudaGitBlobHashFromBytes`'s `Process.Start`/stream-I/O catch (guards a
  git-binary-vanishes-mid-launch failure) has no dedicated test for that specific catch path.
- Round 2h closed the two other entries this list previously carried, by adding the falsifiers
  named under Row G and under the `ATTR3_FIXTURE_GIT_UNAVAILABLE` classification-table row above
  -- removed from this list here, not silently dropped from the round's record.

## Verification, round 2g

- `tools/repo_hygiene/test_um_run_sidefiles.py`: 31 passed, 10 subtests passed. Exit code 0 taken
  directly from the pytest invocation (not through a pipe).
- `tools/repo_hygiene/test_playback_attr_3_cuda_behaviour.py`: 75 passed, 103 subtests passed. Exit
  code 0 taken directly.
- `tools/repo_hygiene/test_attr3_stage_fixture_job.py`: 12 passed. Exit code 0 taken directly.
- Total: 118 passed (31 + 75 + 12), matching the round-2f hub's reported total; HEAD unchanged
  (`bbfb2943`) and `git status --porcelain` clean immediately before this round's first edit.
- **No new test was added this round** for either code fix (item 3's show-toplevel classification
  fix, or item 5's job round-trip verification) -- both are covered only by the existing suites
  continuing to pass, not by a dedicated new race/injection test. Recorded here rather than
  implied: this is a real coverage gap on both fixes, consistent with this round's own rule against
  claiming more than what was actually done.

## Verification, round 2h (item 5)

Both round-2g fixes named above as lacking a falsifier now have one, and both were manually
proven to go RED against a scratch copy of the affected module with the fix reverted (not merely
asserted to pass against the current code -- that would prove nothing an existing-suite-passes
claim doesn't already prove).

- `test_job_bytes_altered_on_the_share_are_refused_and_the_job_is_not_placed`
  (`test_um_run_sidefiles.py`): a `$Copier` corrupts `$tmp` after the copy; asserts
  `UMRUN_JOB_VERIFY_FAILED` and that the corrupted job never reaches `inbox\demo.job.ps1`.
  Verified RED (silent `NO_THROW`, corrupted job placed unnoticed at
  `inbox\demo.job.ps1`) against a scratch copy of `UmRunDrop.psm1` with the round-2g
  hash-then-rename mechanism reverted to a plain copy-then-`Move-Item`, run against a disposable
  inbox/outbox pair outside the tracked tree.
- `test_a_corrupted_repo_config_is_indeterminate_not_not_in_a_repo`
  (`test_playback_attr_3_cuda_behaviour.py`): corrupts `.git/config` with an invalid line so `git
  rev-parse --show-toplevel` fails with git's own `fatal: bad config line` text (confirmed
  empirically on this host, exit 128); asserts `ATTR3_FIXTURE_GIT_UNAVAILABLE`, not
  `ATTR3_FIXTURE_NOT_IN_A_REPO`. Verified RED (throws `ATTR3_FIXTURE_NOT_IN_A_REPO`) against a
  scratch copy of `AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1` with the round-2g stderr inspection reverted to
  `2>$null` plus an unconditional `ATTR3_FIXTURE_NOT_IN_A_REPO` on any failure.
- Full-suite re-run after both falsifiers were added, item 6's anchor tightening, and item 4's
  table-only additions (no code change for item 4): `test_um_run_sidefiles.py` 32 passed / 10
  subtests passed (was 31, +1 for the new falsifier); `test_playback_attr_3_cuda_behaviour.py` 76
  passed / 103 subtests passed (was 75, +1); `test_attr3_stage_fixture_job.py` 12 passed
  (unchanged, no code in this file was touched round 2h). Total 120 passed (32 + 76 + 12). Every
  exit code taken directly from its own `pytest` invocation, never through a pipe.
- **Not measured this round:** a dedicated test for Row H (item 2) -- it is recorded OPEN rather
  than given a falsifier, since no fix was made to falsify against (see Row H's own residual).
  The `UMRUN_FIXTURE_ADMISSION_PATH_RESOLUTION_UNAVAILABLE` TOCTOU throw path and the
  large-fixture-OOM edge remain undriven by any test, unchanged from round 2g.
