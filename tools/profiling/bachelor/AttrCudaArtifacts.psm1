# AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1 -- the ONE definition of the PLAYBACK-ATTR-3-CUDA package naming
# convention, of the build-identity header injected into an archived source tree, and of every
# VERIFICATION the emitted jobs perform before they trust an input.
#
# Three surfaces have to agree on these names without exchanging state:
#   - tools/profiling/bachelor/playback-attr-3-cuda-assemble.ps1 (board host: builds them)
#   - tools/profiling/bachelor/playback-attr-3-cuda-stage-job.ps1 (stages them into the cache)
#   - tools/profiling/bachelor/playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1 (attribution: verifies them)
# The attribution job derives the same names independently from -SourceCommit, which is why
# this module exists: two copies of a convention drift, and the drift shows up as a cache miss
# on a host nobody is watching.
#
# WHY THE VERIFIERS LIVE HERE TOO (sol, PR #133 r2). Each generator emits a self-contained
# <jobId>.job.ps1 that runs on a host with no checkout and no module path, so a job cannot
# Import-Module this file. Instead the generators EMBED the function text VERBATIM, extracted by
# Get-AttrCudaEmbeddedFunctionSource at generation time. The test suite
# (tools/repo_hygiene/test_playback_attr_3_cuda_split_route.py) executes these same functions
# through pwsh, so the code the tests exercise is byte-identical to the code the jobs run --
# which a re-implementation inside a here-string template could never be.

    Return the verbatim source text of named functions in this module, for embedding in an
    emitted job script.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Extraction is textual on purpose: Get-Command .ScriptBlock would return a REBUILT body
    (comments stripped, formatting normalised), so a test asserting "the job embeds what the
    module defines" would be comparing two different strings. Every function in this module
    opens with `function <Name> {` at column 0 and closes with `}` at column 0, and no function
    body contains a line starting with an unindented `}`; that is the contract the regex below
    relies on, and test_embedded_functions_round_trip pins it.

function Expand-AttrCudaTemplate {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Single-pass job-template substitution: every __TOKEN__ placeholder in -Template is replaced
    by -Tokens['TOKEN'] in ONE regex pass, so a substituted value is never rescanned for further
    placeholders.
    .DESCRIPTION
    ATTR3-FOOTAGE-BIND-1 PR-B round 3 (STRUCTURAL). Every generator that emits a <jobId>.job.ps1
    body used to substitute placeholders through a CHAINED .Replace(...).Replace(...) sequence:
    each later .Replace call rescans the ENTIRE string, including text an earlier .Replace call
    just spliced in. A caller-controlled value shaped like another placeholder's own token (e.g.
    -ConsentReceiptFileName 'a__EMBEDDED_FUNCTIONS__b.json', which passes that parameter's own
    ValidatePattern) therefore collided with the LATER __EMBEDDED_FUNCTIONS__ substitution and
    spliced ~600 lines of verifier source into the middle of an unrelated string literal, breaking
    the emitted job's own parse -- and the same window existed for every underscore-permitting
    value and for every generated blob substituted early in the chain.
    [regex]::Replace with a MatchEvaluator processes the ORIGINAL input in ONE pass: the
    evaluator's return value for one match is never itself rescanned for further matches, so this
    closes the whole class at once, for every token, in every generator, rather than patching one
    collision at a time. Per-token quoting/escaping (e.g. doubling an embedded `'` for a
    single-quoted literal context) stays the CALLER's job -- -Tokens values are expected to
    already be escaped for the quoting context they land in, exactly as before this function
    existed; this function only decides WHICH bytes replace WHICH placeholder, never how a value
    is made safe for where it lands.
    Throws AttrCudaTemplateUnknownToken for a template placeholder absent from -Tokens (a typo in
    the template, or a caller who forgot a token), and AttrCudaTemplateUnusedToken for a -Tokens
    entry the template never references (a caller who renamed a placeholder in one place and not
    the other) -- both fail closed rather than silently emitting a literal placeholder or silently
    dropping a caller-supplied value.

    fixed fields, then a uint16 comment length at offset 20 and the comment itself at offset 22.

function Assert-AttrCudaSafeArtifactName {

    Refuse anything that is not a plain file name, and return it.
    .DESCRIPTION
    The staging job used to take artifact names straight out of build.json and feed them to
    Join-Path for cache writes and inbox deletion, while its containment check only covered the
    DIRECTORY roots (sol, PR #133 r2). A name of `..\..\something` therefore produced a path that
    passed the root check and still landed outside it -- on an unattended host, for a
    Remove-Item. A basename cannot do that, so this refuses everything that is not one:
    separators in either direction, any `..` at all, a colon (and so any drive qualifier or
    alternate data stream), the characters Windows forbids in a file name, and surrounding
    whitespace. Assert-AttrCudaDirectChild is the second, independent line.

    .SYNOPSIS
    Authenticate a staged build.json before a single one of its fields is trusted, and return it.
    .DESCRIPTION
    The hash chain used to stop at staging (sol, PR #133 r2): the attribution job took whichever
    same-named build.json happened to be in the MUTABLE agent cache and believed its
    pendingSymbolPresence, its artifact sha256s and its sourceCommit. Replacing build.json plus
    the matching artifacts forged all three at once.
    So: the file's own sha256 is checked against a value baked in by the generator BEFORE
    ConvertFrom-Json runs -- parse order matters, because a parsed field is already a trusted
    field. Then three claims the downstream evidence rests on:
      - sourceCommit must equal the commit the job was generated for;
      - dllPairManifestSha256 must be present and well formed, so the exe's DLL pair is itself
        chained back to the Ultra-Magnus manifest rather than merely asserted;
      - pendingSymbolPresence must be a real boolean, because gpu_job_result_provenance.py
        rejects null/omitted and this host cannot re-derive it.

    pipeline, which decodes/re-encodes command output and would silently rewrite CRLF sequences
    on the way through. Byte-exactness is the entire point: hashing anything else (a working-tree

    dirty tree could quietly disagree with.
    ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-PIN-1 (BLOCKER, round 2): -RepoRoot used to be passed as a `-C $RepoRoot`
    pair inside -ArgumentList, which Start-Process joins into a single command line WITHOUT
    quoting each element. The real repository root contains a space
    (`C:\!Layi Wkspc\MLV-App`), so that command line handed git the bare token `Wkspc\MLV-App` as
    if it were the next argument, and every real-repository call threw ATTRCUDA_BLOB_READ_FAILED.
    -WorkingDirectory sets the child process's start directory directly (never tokenized onto the
    command line), so no argument here can ever contain a space to mis-split.
    Throws ATTRCUDA_BLOB_READ_FAILED.

# ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-DEPS-1 round 3 (NARROW BY REDESIGN), round 4 (contract stated honestly,
# PR #144). Round 1 and round 2 both discovered this closure by SCANNING committed text -- first
# a regex over one literal shape (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot '<name>'), then a fail-closed AST
# literal scan layered on top of it. A design swarm ruled both undiscoverable-by-patching: a
# scanner built on string literals cannot see an extension-less load
# (`& "$PSScriptRoot\helper"`) or a bareword `Import-Module $PSScriptRoot/modx` -- both load
# code; both scanners returned nothing for either -- and the literal-scan classifier matched a
# resolved dependency by BASENAME alone, so an absolute path like 'C:\evil\provenance-stamp.ps1'
# classified cleanly just by sharing a name with a staged file. Removing the heuristic from the
# trust path removes both gaps permanently: the closure is now this EXPLICIT, pinned list --
# never discovered, never inferred.
#
# WHAT Assert-AttrCudaClosureComplete (below) ACTUALLY PROVES, STATED HONESTLY. It is a
# REGRESSION TRIPWIRE over these six reviewed, byte-pinned files at generator time -- never an
# exhaustive proof that no future edit to them can smuggle in an unstaged load. PowerShell
# resolves some commands dynamically (a computed string, a resolved alias), and no static census
# can enumerate every spelling of "load a file" a determined future edit could use. What it DOES
# guarantee: every load site Get-AttrCudaScriptLoadSites' AST census can see in the manifest's
# own committed text -- including a module-qualified or aliased loader name and any abbreviated
# Add-Type -Path/-LiteralPath parameter (sol round-4 majors 1 and 3) -- classifies as a manifest
# sibling, a scriptblock-only invocation, a pathless Add-Type, or a reviewed exact-pair exclusion,
# or generation refuses outright with ATTRCUDA_UNCLASSIFIED_SCRIPT_REFERENCE. An alias
# definition (Set-Alias/sal/New-Alias/nal) is never resolved at census time -- it is ALWAYS
# unclassified, because what it names is undecidable statically (round-4 sol major 2).
#
# THE SAFETY PROPERTY FOR WHATEVER THIS CENSUS CANNOT SEE IS THE RUNTIME PATH, NOT THIS
# FUNCTION: a staged file that fails to load in the smoke child is reported as SMOKE_RUN_FAILED
# (playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1's failure branch, ~:734-780), never silently masked as a
# PresentMon timeout or a clean result. Today's six real files contain none of the forms this
# census cannot see (hub-verified against the real repo by
# test_the_real_current_repo_at_head_classifies_cleanly); this census exists to catch a
# regression the moment one of these six files is edited to add one, not to prove no such form
# could ever exist anywhere PowerShell can run.
#
# ATTR3-VISUAL-QUALITY-EVIDENCE-1 round 2: added gui-smoke-color-artifact-scan.ps1 -- round 1
# had the runner dot-source it directly (~:92) without staging it, so this same census caught the
# gap the same way it was designed to (ATTRCUDA_UNCLASSIFIED_SCRIPT_REFERENCE at that site).
#
# CUDA-S4-TEXTURE-ROUTE-CLAMP-1 round 2: added gui-smoke-gpu-texture-route-validation.ps1 --
# run-release-gui-smoke.ps1 dot-sources it (~:93) but round 1 never staged it, so the same

    AST census of every code-loading SITE in PowerShell source text. FAILS CLOSED on a parse

    .DESCRIPTION
    ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-DEPS-1 round 3. Parses with
    [System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser] and returns every:
      - CommandAst invoked with the dot (.) or call (&) operator (its target may be a literal, a
        variable, or a dynamic expression -- classification is the caller's job);
      - CommandAst named (case-insensitively) Import-Module/ipmo, Start-Process/saps/start,
        pwsh/powershell(.exe), Invoke-Expression/iex, Invoke-Command/icm, Start-Job,
        Start-ThreadJob, Add-Type, Set-Alias/sal or New-Alias/nal -- matched on the segment AFTER
        the last `\`, so a module-qualified invocation
        (`Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Import-Module ...`) is recognized exactly like the
        unqualified form, never invisible to this census (round 4, sol PR #144 major 1);
      - UsingStatementAst (a `using module|namespace|assembly` statement -- never a C# `using`
        keyword sitting inert inside a string literal handed to Add-Type, which this AST walk
        does not descend into because it is a StringConstantExpressionAst, not PowerShell code);
      - InvokeMemberExpressionAst whose member name is (case-insensitively) Create, AddScript,
        AddCommand, InvokeScript or NewScriptBlock;
      - a STATIC InvokeMemberExpressionAst named (case-insensitively) Start on the type
        expression [System.Diagnostics.Process] / [Diagnostics.Process] -- process launch, per
        fable's round-3 minor (round 4, PR #144).
    This finds every SITE that can execute or generate code regardless of how its target is
    spelled -- an extension-less `& "$PSScriptRoot\helper"` or a bareword
    `Import-Module $PSScriptRoot/modx` are both real AST nodes the parser sees even though
    neither contains a string literal a text scanner could match on. Classifying what each site
    loads is Assert-AttrCudaClosureComplete's job, never this function's.
    Throws ATTRCUDA_SCRIPT_PARSE_ERROR on any parse error: a file this scan cannot understand is
    never silently treated as clean.

    unambiguous parameter-name PREFIX -- it bound those abbreviations to -Path/-LiteralPath at
    runtime even though the AST's parameter name is the shorter text actually written. A
    parameter counts as a path parameter here if 'Path' or 'LiteralPath' STARTS WITH the written
    name (case-insensitive, so any valid prefix abbreviation is caught, including the empty-string
    edge of neither name), or if the written name is the PSPath or LP alias. A parameter that is
    merely AMBIGUOUS between a path name and some other Add-Type parameter (e.g. `-Pa` could bind

          (Test-AttrCudaScriptblockOnlyInvocationTarget);
      (c) `Add-Type` with no -Path/-LiteralPath, matched by prefix and alias so an abbreviated
          parameter cannot pass as pathless (Test-AttrCudaCommandHasPathParameter);
      (d) a pinned exclusion (Test-AttrCudaClosureScanExclusionMatch).
    A Set-Alias/sal/New-Alias/nal site is never a candidate for (a)-(c) and matches (d) only if
    explicitly pinned there -- its target is never resolved statically, so it is always
    unclassified unless excluded by name (round 4, sol major 2). Anything else throws
    ATTRCUDA_UNCLASSIFIED_SCRIPT_REFERENCE. Finally, the set of resolved
    class-(a) targets must equal the manifest minus its root (first) entry, in both directions --
    a manifest entry never reached by a real load, or a real load that resolves outside the
    manifest, is a completeness failure, not silently accepted either way.
    Throws ATTRCUDA_BLOB_UNRESOLVED if a manifest path is not a committed blob at -Commit,
    ATTRCUDA_SCRIPT_PARSE_ERROR (from Get-AttrCudaScriptLoadSites), or
    ATTRCUDA_UNCLASSIFIED_SCRIPT_REFERENCE (above).

    Sorted with [StringComparer]::Ordinal (fable minor, PR #144 round 3, carried forward from

    .DESCRIPTION
    ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-DEPS-1 round 3 (NARROW BY REDESIGN). Round 1/2 defined this exact-set rule
    twice -- once inline in the stager's "already staged" check, once inline in the attribution
    job's ATTRCUDA_SMOKE_RUNNER_STALE gate -- which is exactly how the two could silently drift
    apart. Moved here so both emitted jobs embed the BYTE-IDENTICAL function text
    (Get-AttrCudaEmbeddedFunctionSource), never two copies that only look the same. "Matches
    exactly" means: the directory exists, is not itself a reparse point, has EXACTLY -Entries.Count
    children (no extra entries, no subdirectories among them), none of those children is a reparse
    point, and every -Entries member is present with the pinned sha256.
    -Entries is an array of [pscustomobject]@{ name; sha256 } (sha256 in any case; compared
    case-insensitively). A plain array + -contains, not a HashSet: the template lint
    (attr3_publish_write_scan.ps1 R4) only allowlists specific .NET static/instance members by
    name, and this closure is a handful of files, so an O(n) membership test costs nothing here.
    Returns $null on an exact match; otherwise a reason string. Never throws -- the caller (an
    "already staged?" check vs. a hard pin gate) decides what a mismatch means.

    SHA256_MISMATCH. Readability is established BEFORE a length mismatch is ever reported: a part

    (must exist, must not itself be a reparse point) and leaves the destination path alone.

    .DESCRIPTION
    ATTR3-FIXTURE-STAGE-1 (sol, PR #139 r1 MAJOR), narrowly scoped to the fixture stager --
    Publish-AttrCudaFileMove's slot check deletes ANY plain file occupying the destination and
    then moves with -Force, so a different-bytes cache file that arrives between the fixture
    job's own initial existence check and this call is silently removed and replaced. That
    race is closed here, not in the shared helper: the package stager (playback-attr-3-cuda-
    stage-job.ps1) still calls Publish-AttrCudaFileMove and still has it, tracked separately.
    The parent is checked exactly like Assert-AttrCudaWritableFileSlot (must exist, must not be
    a link), but the destination slot itself is never inspected or removed first. .NET's
    [System.IO.File]::Move($Source, $Destination, $false) is the sole arbiter of "is it
    occupied" -- overwrite=$false is atomic on NTFS, so there is no check-then-act window for a
    concurrent writer to land in between the check and the rename.
    On IOException the destination already exists; nothing has been moved, deleted or written
    -- the caller re-hashes the destination (identical bytes: a concurrent publisher already
    finished this exact fixture; different bytes: fail closed) instead of this helper silently
    reporting success either way.
    Throws ATTRCUDA_NONOVERWRITE_DESTINATION_EXISTS when the destination is occupied.

    move), so there is no check-then-act window for a concurrent writer to land in between the

    .DESCRIPTION
    tools/profiling/run-release-gui-smoke.ps1 does NOT write into <output dir>\logs. It creates a
    GUID-nonced directory per run and then snapshots the exact lines its own result consumed:

        $runNonce = [Guid]::NewGuid().ToString("N")
        $outputStem = [IO.Path]::GetFileNameWithoutExtension($outputPath)
        $logRoot = Join-Path $outputDir ("logs-{0}-{1}" -f $outputStem, $runNonce)
        ...
        # Preserve the exact lines consumed by this result in a per-run immutable
        # snapshot.  The aggregate rotating app log is allowed to grow later and is
        # therefore diagnostic only; comparison authority comes from this snapshot.
        $runLogSnapshotPath = "$outputPath.run.log"
        [System.IO.File]::WriteAllLines($runLogSnapshotPath, [string[]]$recentLines, $utf8NoBom)
        $runLogSnapshotBinding = Get-EvidenceFileBinding `
            -Path $runLogSnapshotPath -Label "run log snapshot"

    and exposes both through result.json:

        log = [pscustomobject]@{
            path = $runLogSnapshotPath
            aggregateSourcePath = if ($logFile) { $logFile.FullName } else { $null }
        ...
        evidence = [pscustomobject]@{
            runNonce = $runNonce
            inputs = $captureInputBindings
            runLogSnapshot = $runLogSnapshotBinding

    So `logs\mlvapp-*.log` under the job's own output directory NEVER EXISTS, and a glob for it
    cannot reach any gate behind it (sol, PR #133 r2). This resolves `log.path`, the snapshot the
    runner itself calls the comparison authority, and binds it to
    `evidence.runLogSnapshot.sha256` so a log swapped after the run is refused rather than read.
    `log.aggregateSourcePath` is returned for the record but never read: the runner's own comment
    says the aggregate rotating log may grow after the run and is diagnostic only.
    Throws with a distinguishable ATTRCUDA_SMOKE_* token.

    .SYNOPSIS
    Parse a raw PresentMon CSV into presented/displayed rates for the MLVApp preview chain, or a
    typed non-throwing refusal -- PRESENTMON_UNAVAILABLE or DISPLAY_ASLEEP -- never an uncaught
    exception once the smoke run itself has already passed.
    .DESCRIPTION
    CUDA-PERF-DISPLAY-IDENTITY-HARNESS-1/2/3. Defects this closes:
      - a missing or unreadable presentmon.csv used to reach Import-Csv unguarded and crash the
        whole job with nothing published (evidence: 3 of 8 baseline attempts on Bachelor died at
        Import-Csv of a missing out\diagnostic\presentmon.csv after a full smoke run);
      - "no positive MsBetweenDisplayChange samples" was an uncaught throw AFTER a passed smoke
        run, destroying every artifact already produced instead of reporting a typed outcome;
      - PresentMon runs --timed 55 against a --seconds 40 playback, so its raw CSV always
        contains idle desktop/startup presents outside the measured window; without restricting
        to that window, those contaminate the rate for whichever swap chain looks busiest;
      - (HARNESS-2, sol BLOCKER 3) the required-column set used to include a `DisplayedTime`
        column that the pinned PresentMon 2.5.1 legacy launch never emits -- every real capture
        read PRESENTMON_UNAVAILABLE. The required set now matches the real legacy CSV header
        exactly (Application, ProcessID, SwapChainAddress, PresentMode, MsBetweenPresents,
        MsBetweenDisplayChange, MsUntilDisplayed, TimeInMs, all confirmed present in real Bachelor
        captures), and "displayed" is derived from MsBetweenDisplayChange or MsUntilDisplayed --
        both real columns -- never from the fictional one;
      - (HARNESS-2, sol HARDENING) a swap chain recreated mid-run (e.g. a resize) used to split
        one continuous MLVApp preview across two (ProcessID, SwapChainAddress) groups, and only
        the busier one was reported, silently dropping the other's frames. The logical preview is
        now every row for the target PID, summed across every swap chain address it used inside
        the window.
      - (HARNESS-3, sol+fable HARDENING) HARNESS-2 windowed rows against a single guessed
        TimeInMs origin and claimed, in a comment, that anchoring on the earlier endpoint of the
        capture-start bracket "never excludes a row that truly falls inside the playback window".
        That direction argument was inverted: an anchor at or before PresentMon's true trace-
        session origin makes every row's own TimeInMs read SMALLER than it would under the true
        origin, which shifts the comparison window LATER and CAN exclude a genuine front-edge
        row -- the opposite of the claim. Neither endpoint is asserted exact in either direction
        any more. This function now windows the rows under BOTH endpoints of the caller's
        persisted capture-start bracket, reports presented/displayed counts and rates for each,
        counts how many rows' in/out window membership disagrees between them, and heads the
        report with whichever endpoint admits more DISPLAYED MLVApp rows (then more presented
        rows; ties to the earlier endpoint), so no display verdict rests on the endpoint that
        happened to miss the displayed rows. See .clockBracket below.
    Every row is also grouped by (ProcessID, SwapChainAddress) for .chains -- the actual display
    identity PresentMon reports, since a PID alone conflates multiple swap chains and a swap chain
    address alone says nothing about which process owns it -- but .selectedChain and
    .selectedChainRows are the PID-level aggregate described above, not a single address's rows.
    Windowing: TimeInMs is read as milliseconds since each of -EarliestCaptureStartUtc and
    -LatestCaptureStartUtc in turn (the two endpoints of the wall-clock bracket the caller places
    around PresentMon's own startup -- see playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1); only rows whose derived
    timestamp falls within [process.startedAtUtc, process.endedAtUtc] -- the exact lifetime of the
    launched MLVApp process -- count toward either rate, so idle time before launch or after exit
    (up to ~15s of it, per --timed 55 against --seconds 40) never counts as a display sample under
    either endpoint. .clockBracket on every returned status reports both endpoints' counts/rates,
    .rowsDifferingInWindowMembership (the count of rows -- across every process, not just
    MLVApp's -- whose in/out status flips between the two endpoints), and .headline/.headlineReason
    naming which endpoint .chains/.selectedChain/.selectedChainRows are actually built from.
    A "displayed" sample is MsBetweenDisplayChange > 0, or (when that field is NA -- observed on
    the very first present of a capture) MsUntilDisplayed > 0: either is a genuine screen update.
    A "presented" sample is any row for the PID, including one that never displayed -- kept, never
    discarded, so the presented rate is not silently inflated by discarding it and not silently
    deflated by treating it as a display.
    Returns .status one of 'OK' | 'PRESENTMON_UNAVAILABLE' | 'DISPLAY_ASLEEP'; .reason is $null
    only for 'OK'. On 'OK', .chains lists every (ProcessID, SwapChainAddress) group observed in
    the window, for audit; .selectedChain is the PID-level aggregate (its swapChainAddresses lists
    every address summed into it). Both carry .presentModes -- every distinct PresentMode string
    observed in that chain's rows, with its own row count (PRESENTMON-HARNESS-ROBUSTNESS-1) -- so
    a leg admitting only a handful of rows (e.g. a full-screen leg that lost most of its samples)
    can be diagnosed from evidence alone: an exclusive/hardware mode dropping to a composed one
    mid-capture is a real signal PresentMon itself reports, not something counts alone can show.
    .selectedChainRows carries only its positive-display rows,
    shaped exactly like this job's historical pmRows
    (ordinal/timeInMs/msBetweenDisplayChange/displayFpsEquivalent/presentMode), for
    presentmon-series.csv -- tools/profiling/refresh_period_histogram.py depends on that exact
    column name and never sees this function or its chain-selection at all. A row displayed only
    via MsUntilDisplayed (MsBetweenDisplayChange reads NA) carries msBetweenDisplayChange=$null and
    displayFpsEquivalent=$null here -- it is a genuine displayed sample with no interval to report,
    never a zero one; every caller aggregating msBetweenDisplayChange across .selectedChainRows
    must filter $null/non-positive values out BEFORE computing statistics, exactly as
    refresh_period_histogram.py already does reading the CSV this produces.
