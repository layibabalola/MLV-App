# Attr3FootageStageJob.psm1 -- job-TEXT construction for attr3-footage-stage.ps1, split out of
# the CLI generator so a test can build and run a job from SYNTHETIC parts and a SYNTHETIC
# staging directory directly, without the generator's CLI surface ever offering a way to skip the
# resolver (ATTR3-FOOTAGE-STAGE-1; mirrors Attr3FootagePresenceJob.psm1's own split, round 2,
# defect 3, of that generator).
#
# WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT DO. It never calls the resolver, never reads git, never reads
# tools/gates/output-budget.json or the hook's consent table, and never touches a network share
# itself -- it only builds job TEXT from already-resolved parts. Whether those parts actually
# correspond to a real owner-consented clip, and whether the bytes named by their staging slot
# actually arrived there, are entirely the CALLER's problem: for the real CLI path that caller is
# attr3-footage-stage.ps1, which obtains parts from tools/gates/resolve_consented_clip.py alone
# and stages them itself through AttrCudaOwnerFootage.psm1's Send-AttrCudaOwnerFootagePartToStaging
# before ever calling this function.
#
# WHAT THE EMITTED JOB DOES, ON BACHELOR. First it proves the whole staging chain under
# -AgentRoot, down to and including the per-job staging directory itself, carries no reparse
# point -- before touching anything under it (ATTR3-FOOTAGE-STAGE-1 round 3). For each part: it
# re-verifies the staged copy against the length/sha256 this generator baked in (never trusting
# that a byte-identical local copy stayed byte-identical once it crossed the share), creates the
# resolver's spec directory if it is missing, then PLACES the file at the resolver's spec path
# NON-OVERWRITING via a same-volume verified copy: the staged bytes are copied into an owned,
# per-attempt partial slot ON THE TARGET'S OWN VOLUME, verified there, renamed into place with a
# same-volume atomic rename, and the bytes actually AT the spec path are re-hashed before the
# part is ever reported PLACED -- so a cross-volume interruption can never expose a partial file
# at the spec path, and PLACED always means "these exact bytes are confirmed there now" (round 3;
# a direct cross-volume File.Move used to become copy-then-delete with no such guarantee). A file
# already there with matching bytes is a no-op PASS, a file there with DIFFERENT bytes is refused
# (TARGET_CONFLICT) and the target is never touched -- there is no recovery path: a failed run is
# simply re-run (ATTR3-FOOTAGE-STAGE-1 round 8 scope cut removed the round 5/6 residue-marker
# recovery mechanism, which a review found could delete an ordinary unowned file occupying its
# fixed marker name; see this module's own CHANGELOG note below). Either way the job removes only
# the staging-share neutral file and the local partial slot IT created; nothing else in either
# directory is ever enumerated or touched. Reports by part index and status only -- never a path,
# in any branch, on any exit.
#
# ATTR3-FOOTAGE-STAGE-1 round 8 (scope cut): every start-of-run STALE-PARTIAL SWEEP (this job's
# own target-volume local-partial sweep, and AttrCudaOwnerFootage.psm1's share-side stale-attempt
# sweep the CLI used to run) and the residue-marker recovery mechanism (round 5/6's fixed-name
# sidecar authorizing a later run to delete a retained mismatched target) are REMOVED. Every one
# of round 3 through 7's own findings traced back to that machinery layered on top of the core
# transfer, not the core transfer itself -- most recently a review finding that the recovery
# branch could delete an ordinary file at the fixed marker name this tool does not own. The
# replacement policy: a target that already holds bytes THIS job just published (its own
# non-overwriting rename) and fails its post-rename re-hash is removed -- that file, and only that
# file, came from this job's own rename -- and reported with a failing token; nothing else is ever
# recovered automatically. A failed run is simply re-run.
#
# WHY BASE64, NOT A CHARACTER ALLOWLIST. Same reasoning as Attr3FootagePresenceJob.psm1's own
# header: the job template wraps $PartsJson in a SINGLE-QUOTED PowerShell string literal, so a raw
# path containing a `'` would break out of that literal once JSON-encoded (JSON escapes `"`, not
# `'`). Encoding each path as base64 of its UTF-8 bytes removes the character class that can do
# that; the binding that actually matters -- the resolver's own cross-check of this path against
# the frozen consent table, upstream of this module entirely -- is what is trusted, not a guess at
# which characters a real path can safely contain.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Build and write a <jobId>.job.ps1 that places already-share-verified footage parts at their
    resolver-designated spec path on Bachelor.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Each part's path is embedded in the emitted job as base64 of its UTF-8 bytes, decoded on
    Bachelor via the module's own Read-AttrCudaBase64Payload (embedded verbatim) -- never as an
    interpolated string. The structural sanity check below (drive letter, colon, separator, no
    control characters) is defense in depth over the resolver's own cross-check against the
    frozen consent table; it is NOT what makes the embedding injection-safe -- the base64
    encoding is, regardless of what this check would have allowed through (see
    Attr3FootagePresenceJob.psm1's identical validation for the same reasoning).
    Throws a distinguishable ATTR3_STAGE_* token on any refusal; returns a pscustomobject
    describing the emitted job otherwise. The returned jobId carries a fresh random component
    (round 3) so every call gets a unique id regardless of content -- a caller names the SAME
    per-job staging directory on the agent share by using this RETURNED value, never by
    recomputing it, and a retried invocation for the SAME clip and parts never collides with an
    earlier attempt's own retained result receipt. sourceSha256 (also returned) is the stable,
    content-derived audit/dedup key the id itself used to be.
    On Bachelor, the emitted job's per-part status is one of PLACED, ALREADY_PRESENT,
    TARGET_CONFLICT (a different file already occupies the spec path, or the post-rename removal
    below could not be verified -- either way the target is left exactly as found, never
    recovered automatically; round 8 scope cut removed the round 5/6 residue-marker recovery
    path), TARGET_PATH_UNSAFE, TARGET_STATE_UNKNOWN, TARGET_DIR_FAILED,
    TARGET_VOLUME_PARTIAL_EXISTS (round 4: the target-volume partial slot is already occupied --
    refused, untouched, never this job's to delete), TARGET_VOLUME_COPY_FAILED,
    TARGET_VOLUME_VERIFY_<Test-AttrCudaFootagePart status> (the same-volume partial copy failed
    verification), PLACED_VERIFY_<status> (the post-rename re-hash at the spec path failed and the
    target IT just placed was successfully removed, round 4), PLACED_VERIFY_FAILED_TARGET_RETAINED
    (round 4/8: that removal itself could not be verified -- the bytes THIS job just placed are
    retained, reported and left in place; a later run then sees a mismatched target and refuses
    TARGET_CONFLICT, never a silent recovery), STAGE_SLOT_INVALID, STAGED_PATH_UNSAFE (round 4:
    the staged file's own leaf is a reparse point) or STAGED_<status> (the staged copy itself
    failed verification); the overall result is FOOTAGE_STAGED (exit 0) when every part is PLACED
    or ALREADY_PRESENT, else FOOTAGE_STAGE_REFUSED (exit 1). No exception's own text ever reaches
    this job's output, since it can contain a real path.
