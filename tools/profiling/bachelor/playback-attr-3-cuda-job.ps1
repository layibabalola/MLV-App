# playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1 -- GENERATOR (runs locally / in a lane; nothing here runs

# (tools/profiling/ultra-magnus-agent.ps1 protocol: inbox\<jobId>.job.ps1 in,
# outbox\<jobId>.result.json out).
#
# Modelled on:
#   - the PLAYBACK-ATTR-2 job body (quiescence check, cache hash checks,
#     run-release-gui-smoke.ps1 invocation, prep_region_* frame parsing, PresentMon
#     sidecar handshake, evidence-manifest.json) -- see

#
# FOOTAGE (ATTR3-FOOTAGE-BIND-1, PR-B): an owner-clip id is RESOLVED, never handed a path. The
# generator calls tools/gates/resolve_consented_clip.py (PR-A) as a child process with
# --emit-json: the resolver alone proves that the frozen spec's parts for this id (length,
# sha256, and the hook's own norm() of the path) agree with the hook's frozen consent table
# (OWNER_CONSENTED_FOOTAGE in tools/hooks/mlv-never-authorized.py). A non-zero resolver exit is a
# refusal -- this generator throws with the resolver's typed status and emits nothing, never a
# path. On success, each part's path/length/sha256 is baked into the emitted job as base64 of its
# UTF-8 bytes (never an interpolated literal -- see Attr3FootagePresenceJob.psm1's header for
# why), so the job that runs on Bachelor re-checks every part's CONTENT against the live
# filesystem -- via the shared Test-AttrCudaFootagePart verifier -- before it opens anything,
# never trusting that "the resolver approved it" means the bytes are still there.
# -ClipPath and -FixtureSha256 are both REFUSED for an owner id: there is no owner-typed path on
# this route, and a content hash is meaningless without the resolver's own cross-check against
# the frozen table. An interpreter one-liner can still open any path; that residual is
# unchanged. Every verified part -- base part and any continuation part alike -- is named by
# THIS code, never the application: each gets a neutral view name (AttrCudaOwnerFootage.psm1's
# Get-AttrCudaOwnerFootageNeutralName) -- a file symbolic link to the original where the venue can
# create one, else a verified byte copy, NEVER a hard link (OWNER-FOOTAGE-NO-HARDLINK-1) -- a
# read-only pin held on the ORIGINAL before the smoke child ever runs, and a re-verification of
# the view's content against the resolved length/sha256 while those handles are held, all under a
# private per-job directory the application only ever sees by its neutral names. The owner's consent record (receipts/owner-footage-consent-20260916.json
# and its -correction.json) is evidence of consent, never an authorization. Adjudication:
# .claude-state/fleet-runs/swarm-footage-route-20260916T2020Z/SYNTHESIS.md (round 1);
# ATTR3-FOOTAGE-BIND-1 (round 2, this file).
#
# FIXTURE REHEARSAL (ATTR3-FIXTURE-REHEARSAL-1, extended by ATTR3-FIXTURE-STAGE-1): -ClipId
# may instead be exactly 'tiny_dual_iso' or 'large_dual_iso' -- the two tracked fixtures under
# tests/fixtures/clips/, admitted by NA-4 without a CLIP_OR_NONE authorization because they
# never resolve through an id-to-file lookup either. -ClipPath is OPTIONAL for a fixture id:
# omitted, it is derived as the agent cache path for -ClipId; supplied, it must still resolve
# to the agent cache with BaseName -ceq $ClipId. -ClipPath is REFUSED outright for an owner id
# (see FOOTAGE above); only the fixture arm ever takes one. A fixture
# id also requires -FixtureSha256 (64 lowercase hex, baked by attr3-stage-fixture-job.ps1 and
# printed on its own result line): the emitted job hashes the cached clip before it is ever
# opened and fails closed at FIXTURE_CONTENT_MISMATCH (exit 17) on a mismatch -- a cache file
# name proves nothing about its bytes. Such a run bakes fixtureRehearsal=true into every
# summary.json/evidence-manifest.json this job writes, so a fixture run can never be read as
# an attribution result.
#
# Differences from PLAYBACK-ATTR-2:
#   - shipping-default scale (4), NOT forced to 1: no MLVAPP_PLAYBACK_SCALE_FACTOR
#     override is emitted, and -ScaleFactor 4 is passed explicitly.
#   - asserts GPU recon frames > 0 and cpu_frames == 0 from the LAST
#     playback_smoke.gpu_summary line, so a silent CPU fallback fails the job instead
#     of quietly reporting a CPU-path attribution as if it were CUDA.
#   - writes a provenance.json sidecar (top-level rangeHeadSha/llrawprocBlobId/
#     dllSha256/pendingSymbolPresence) that validates under
#     tools/repo_hygiene/gpu_job_result_provenance.py.
#   - the exe/DLL under test are NOT pinned SHA256 constants (PLAYBACK-ATTR-2 already
#     had a built artifact to pin); they are named deterministically from -SourceCommit
#     and expected to already be staged in the Bachelor cache by the split-build route's
#     staging job (tools/profiling/bachelor/playback-attr-3-cuda-stage-job.ps1), which uses
#     the IDENTICAL naming convention. Their hashes are computed fresh at run time and
#     verified against the staged build manifest, not asserted against a value this
#     generator could not have known.
#
# SPLIT BUILD (swarm ruling 2026-09-16,
# .claude-state/fleet-runs/swarm-attr3-buildhost-20260916T2150Z/SYNTHESIS.md). Bachelor has
# no VC tools and no CUDA toolkit, so NOTHING is compiled or inspected with MSVC tooling
# here. The CUDA DLL pair is built on Ultra-Magnus, the exe on the board host, and the
# package is staged into the Bachelor cache by a staging job. Two consequences in this file:
#   - pendingSymbolPresence is READ from the staged build manifest (the old on-Bachelor
#     MSVC export-inspection probe is gone; it could only ever throw here);
#   - the run's own gpu_playback_recon.eligibility diagnostics are parsed BEFORE any
#     verdict, and the job exits 15 (BACKEND_NOT_AVAILABLE) unless
#     cuda_backend_available=1 and r16_available=1, recording both plus r16_reason.
#
# WHICH LOG (sol, PR #133 r2, BLOCKER). The eligibility line is read from the log
# run-release-gui-smoke.ps1 itself designates for the run just executed --
# result.json's `log.path`, the "$outputPath.run.log" per-run snapshot it calls the
# comparison authority -- bound to `evidence.runLogSnapshot.sha256`. NEVER from a glob
# over out\diagnostic\logs, which cannot match anything: that runner writes into a
# GUID-nonced logs-<stem>-<nonce> directory. The exact lines relied on are quoted beside
# the call. A log that is absent, unbound or outside this job's work tree exits 16
# (SMOKE_LOG_UNAVAILABLE) -- a missing gate is never a passed gate.

    The playback_smoke session id of the MEASURED interval -- BLOCKER fix (r1c): with a

    playback_smoke session (see MainWindow.cpp's on_actionPlay_toggled and the

    HARDENING (r1d, sol; rebound in CUDA-PLAYBACK-CONTACT-SHEET-2): bind to the app's own
    explicit "playback_smoke.measured_session id=N" marker when the log carries one, rather
    than positionally assuming the first playback_smoke.summary line is the measured one -- an
    alternate GUI-smoke mode (e.g. an Auto Look Assist warmup or lifecycle stress pass that
    opens its own session first) could make that assumption false. As of
    CUDA-PLAYBACK-CONTACT-SHEET-2, MainWindow.cpp's runGuiPlaybackSmoke() logs this marker
    itself, right after the measured play trigger that opens the measured session -- not from
    finishPlaybackSmokeTelemetry() on a "play-stop", which a warmup settle or an in-loop
    lifecycle-stress toggle could reach first and mislabel. Falls back to the old first-summary
    heuristic against a log from a build that predates the marker, so this never regresses an
    older build's run: on such a log, the measured interval's own
    playback_smoke.summary/gpu_summary line pair runs strictly BEFORE the contact-sheet capture
    block even starts (see runGuiPlaybackSmoke's own ordering comment), so every session opened
    afterwards is chronologically LATER, and the FIRST playback_smoke.summary line's session id
    is still the measured one.

# somewhere between process creation and Start-PresentMonCapture returning (it blocks up to 3s to
# confirm the process is still alive) -- neither endpoint of that interval IS the true origin, so
# the interval is bracketed instead of guessed at as a single instant. $presentMonProc.StartTime
# is the OS's own report of when the child process itself began (available without any extra
# probing); HARNESS-2 anchored windowing on it alone and claimed here that doing so "never
# excludes a row that truly falls inside the playback window" because it can only be at or before
# PresentMon's true trace-session start. That direction argument was inverted (fable, HARNESS-2
# review): an anchor AT OR BEFORE the true origin makes every row's own TimeInMs read SMALLER than
# it would under the true origin, which shifts the window's comparison threshold LATER and CAN
# exclude a genuine front-edge row -- the opposite of what was claimed, and exactly the failure
# direction that would silently under-report a real display rate. Neither endpoint of the bracket
# is asserted exact in either direction any more:
# Get-AttrCudaPresentMonDisplayReport instead windows the rows under BOTH endpoints --
# $presentMonCaptureStartUtc (process creation, or the pre-spawn wall clock below when the OS
# reported none) and $presentMonPostSpawnUtc (Start-PresentMonCapture returning) -- and reports
# counts/rates for both plus how many rows disagree on window membership between them, heading the
# report with whichever endpoint admits more DISPLAYED rows, then presented rows (see .clockBracket on
# $displayReport below). The full bracket (pre-spawn wall clock, the OS-reported process start,
# post-spawn wall clock) and the residual uncertainty it implies are all persisted below, before
# parsing, so a consumer needing a tighter join than this one can see exactly how much slack to
# allow rather than trusting a single unbracketed stamp.

# see that checkpoint's own comment further down). The
# periodic keep-alive ticks on its own timer with no secure-screensaver check of its own (see

# loop's own try/catch) -- so its health (did it ever start, has a nudge failed, did its

#
# PRESENTMON-HARNESS-ROBUSTNESS-2 (sol BLOCKER, PR #174 r1): the check above ($pmIntervalRows.Count

# could not establish cadence over the whole 25-40s playback (the disclosed full-screen leg had
# presentedCount=1) still read as display-cadence corroborated, and the histogram consumer turned
# that one interval into a 100% one-refresh bucket. 'ok' requires a minimum absolute COUNT of
# positive-interval samples (below) -- an order of magnitude below the low end of the real windowed
# range on record (~150-240 displayed rows over 25-40s), so a genuinely thin/full-screen-style leg
# (0-2 samples) still reads degraded while a healthy leg clears it with wide margin.
#
# PRESENTMON-HARNESS-ROBUSTNESS-2 r1b (sol BLOCKER, pre-review): r1's coverage arm divided
# positiveSamples by $displayReport.selectedChain.presentedCount -- both numerator and denominator
# came from the SAME PresentMon csv, so a capture that lost the tail of a 25-40s leg after a short
# healthy prefix still read coverage=1.0 over its own truncated rows. 'ok' now requires THREE
# independent arms, cleared together, each named in the reason on failure:
#   (1) COUNT: unchanged from r1, above.
#   (2) APP-SWAP COVERAGE: positiveSamples over an app-side swap count PresentMon never produced --
#       Get-AttrCudaAppSwapTelemetry reads the MLVApp log's own swap/frame telemetry (never this
#       csv). A log carrying neither line leaves coverage unavailable, which fails this arm rather
#       than dividing by zero or by a PresentMon-derived count again.
#   (3) TEMPORAL: no gap between positive-interval rows -- including the head/tail gaps to the
#       playback window's own bounds -- exceeds $presentMonSufficiencyMaxGapMs. (1) and (2) alone
#       cannot catch a captured PREFIX followed by silence: a leg that captures
#       >= $presentMonSufficiencyMinIntervalCount rows in the first couple of seconds of a 25-40s
#       leg then loses the rest can still clear a count floor and a swap-count-based coverage ratio
#       while having measured almost none of the actual leg. maxGapMs is an order of magnitude
