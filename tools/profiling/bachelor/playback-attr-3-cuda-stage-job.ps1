# playback-attr-3-cuda-stage-job.ps1 -- GENERATOR (runs locally / in a lane; nothing here runs
# on Bachelor). Emits a self-contained <jobId>.job.ps1 that takes the package
# tools/profiling/bachelor/playback-attr-3-cuda-assemble.ps1 built on the board host -- dropped
# into the Bachelor agent inbox as plain side-files -- and publishes it into the agent cache in
# the layout tools/profiling/bachelor/playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1 (the attribution job)
# verifies.
#
# WHY A JOB AND NOT A COPY. NA-7: direct hooked writes to \\bachelor\... are refused; the
# tracked submitter tools/profiling/um-run.ps1 is the route, and the agent only ever EXECUTES
# inbox\*.job.ps1 while leaving every other inbox file alone. So the hub drops the artifacts
# beside the job and this job does the publishing, on the host, with the hashes re-checked
# there. Nothing in this file hides a path in a variable to route around that boundary.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES. Every expected file name and lowercase sha256 is BAKED IN at generation time.
# On the host the job re-hashes each side-file and refuses on the first mismatch, then
# cross-checks the arriving build.json against the same baked values -- so neither a stale
# side-file nor an edited manifest can publish a package that does not match what was assembled.
#
# NAMES ARE DERIVED, NEVER TAKEN FROM THE MANIFEST (sol, PR #133 r2, BLOCKER). build.json used to
# supply the file names that were then handed to Join-Path for cache writes and inbox deletion,
# with containment checked only on the directory roots -- so a crafted `..\..\x` name produced a
# path that passed the root check and still escaped it, on an unattended host, for a Remove-Item.
# Both this generator and the emitted job now derive the expected basenames from the (baked)
# sourceCommit through Get-AttrCudaArtifactNames and require an EXACT match; the manifest is
# reduced to a source of hashes. Every name is additionally run through
# Assert-AttrCudaSafeArtifactName, and every resolved cache and inbox path through
# Assert-AttrCudaDirectChild, BEFORE any Copy-Item, Move-Item or Remove-Item. Exit 6.
#
# `<jobId>.job.ps1 -VerifyOnly` runs the whole read-only prefix -- name derivation, path
# containment, side-file presence, hashes, manifest binding -- and exits without creating,
# copying, publishing or deleting anything.
#
# ORDER. Artifacts are copied to <name>.partial in the cache, hash-verified there, renamed, and
# only then is build.json published -- LAST, exactly as the attribution job assumes: its mere
# presence means the exe, the DLL and the package zip beside it are complete and verified.
#
# NO FOOTAGE. This job moves build artifacts. It never opens, names, globs or resolves a media
# file, and it never enumerates the cache.
