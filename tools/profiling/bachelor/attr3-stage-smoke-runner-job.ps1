# attr3-stage-smoke-runner-job.ps1 -- GENERATOR (runs locally; nothing here runs on Bachelor).
# Emits a job that publishes the FULL dependency CLOSURE of run-release-gui-smoke.ps1 -- the
# smoke runner tools/profiling/bachelor/playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1 launches -- into the
# Bachelor agent cache under one content-addressed cache DIRECTORY, so that job's closure pin
# (ATTRCUDA_SMOKE_RUNNER_STALE) has verified bytes to match against every file in it
# (ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-DEPS-1).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-PIN-1 staged the runner alone. Bachelor still could
# not launch it: run-release-gui-smoke.ps1 dot-sources gui-smoke-screenshot-provenance.ps1,
# gui-smoke-color-artifact-scan.ps1, gui-smoke-gpu-texture-route-validation.ps1 and
# provenance-stamp.ps1, and imports gui-smoke-process-boundary.psm1, all resolved through
# $PSScriptRoot at runtime -- none of the five was ever staged, so the runner died at its own
# first dot-source line
# ("...gui-smoke-screenshot-provenance.ps1 is not recognized"). The app never launched;
# PresentMon never saw its target and never exited; PRESENTMON_TIMEOUT masked the real cause. The
# fix stages the runner's WHOLE closure together, under their original file names, in one
# directory, so $PSScriptRoot resolves every one of them.
#
# THE CLOSURE IS AN EXPLICIT, PINNED MANIFEST -- NEVER DISCOVERED (ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-DEPS-1
# round 3, NARROW BY REDESIGN; contract restated honestly round 4, PR #144). Round 1 and round 2
# derived this closure by SCANNING committed text; a design swarm ruled that undiscoverable-by-
# patching (a literal-based scanner cannot see every real load shape, and a basename-only
# classifier can be fooled by an unrelated file sharing a staged one's name). The closure is now
# the fixed list in Get-AttrCudaSmokeRunnerClosureManifest (AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1);
# Resolve-AttrCudaSmokeRunnerClosure does nothing but resolve each pinned path's committed bytes.
# Assert-AttrCudaClosureComplete is the generator-time REGRESSION TRIPWIRE that keeps the pinned
# list honest -- an AST census over each manifest file's own committed text, throwing
# ATTRCUDA_UNCLASSIFIED_SCRIPT_REFERENCE the moment a load site cannot be classified. It is a
# tripwire over these six reviewed files, not a proof that covers every future edit; the runtime
# path (playback-attr-3-cuda-job.ps1's SMOKE_RUN_FAILED branch) is the real safety property for
# whatever it cannot see. Full contract at AttrCudaArtifacts.psm1, above the manifest.
#
# CONTENT-ADDRESSED DIRECTORY, NOT A FIXED NAME (mirrors ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-PIN-1 round 2's
# reasoning for the single-file cache name). The published directory is named
# `smoke-runner-<first 16 hex of the closure digest>`, where the digest is the sha256 of the
# sorted `<sha256>  <name>` lines of the closure's committed blobs (Get-AttrCudaClosureDigestHex).
# Distinct closures publish under distinct directory names, so this stager never has to contend
# with -- or touch -- whatever a prior commit's closure already staged.
#
# NO SIDE FILE (mirrors ATTR3-SMOKE-RUNNER-PIN-1 round 2). Every closure file's exact committed
# bytes travel INLINE in the emitted job, base64-encoded, one entry per file. On Bachelor the job
# decodes and verifies EVERY file's sha256 against its own baked pin BEFORE a single byte is
# written to disk, then publishes the whole directory through one atomic, non-overwriting rename
# -- built under a temp name, verified, then renamed into place.
#
# `<jobId>.job.ps1 -VerifyOnly` runs the read-only prefix (name safety, base64 decode, hash for
# every file) and exits without creating, publishing or deleting anything.
#
# NO FOOTAGE. This job moves tracked repository scripts. It never opens, names, globs or resolves
# a media file, and it never enumerates the cache.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -NoProfile -File tools\profiling\bachelor\attr3-stage-smoke-runner-job.ps1 `
#       -SourceCommit <40-hex> -OutDir <staging-dir>
# then submit the emitted <jobId>.job.ps1 to Bachelor the same way any other job in this route is
# submitted -- it needs no side file at all; every closure file's bytes travel inside the job.
