# Attr3FootagePresenceJob.psm1 -- job-TEXT construction for attr3-footage-presence-job.ps1, split
# out of the CLI generator so a test can build a job from SYNTHETIC parts directly, without the
# generator's CLI surface ever offering a way to skip the resolver (ATTR3-FOOTAGE-BIND-1, PR-A,
# round 2, defect 3).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. -InjectResolvedPartsJsonPathForTests used to be a public parameter on
# the CLI generator (attr3-footage-presence-job.ps1): passing it from ANY caller, not just a test,
# skipped the resolver child process entirely -- and with it, the resolver's cross-check of the
# frozen spec against the hook's frozen consent table. New-Attr3FootagePresenceJob below takes
# already-resolved parts as in-memory objects; nothing on the generator's real CLI surface
# (-ClipId/-OutDir/-RepoRoot only -- see that script) can reach this function except by calling
# the resolver first and handing its output here. A test imports THIS MODULE directly and calls
# the function with fabricated parts, which is an ordinary PowerShell function call, not a flag on
# the production entry point.
#
# WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT DO. It never calls the resolver, never reads git, and never reads
# tools/gates/output-budget.json or the hook's consent table. Whether the parts it is handed
# actually correspond to a real owner-consented clip is entirely the caller's problem; for the
# real CLI path that caller is attr3-footage-presence-job.ps1, which obtains parts from
# tools/gates/resolve_consented_clip.py alone.
#
# WHY BASE64, NOT A CHARACTER ALLOWLIST (round 2, defect 1). Every real consented part path in
# tools/gates/output-budget.json uses FORWARD slashes (drive letter, colon, then `/`-separated
# segments), and a measurement host's own TEMP root can carry an `~` from an 8.3 short name --
# both real, both previously rejected by a backslash-only allowlist regex that this module does
# not carry forward. What actually has to be safe is the embedding: the job template below wraps
# $PartsJson in a SINGLE-QUOTED PowerShell string literal, so a raw path containing a `'` would
# break out of that literal into arbitrary template code once JSON-encoded (JSON escapes `"`, not
# `'`). Encoding each path as base64 of its UTF-8 bytes removes the character class that can do
# that -- base64 output is `[A-Za-z0-9+/=]` only -- so the binding that actually matters (the
# resolver's cross-check against the frozen table, including path_norm_sha256) is what is trusted,
# not a guess at which characters a real path can safely contain.

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Build and write a <jobId>.job.ps1 footage-presence probe from already-resolved parts.
    .DESCRIPTION
    Each part's path is embedded in the emitted job as base64 of its UTF-8 bytes, decoded on
    Bachelor via the module's own Read-AttrCudaBase64Payload (embedded verbatim, the same helper
    tools/profiling/bachelor/attr3-stage-smoke-runner-job.ps1 uses for its inline payload) --
    never as an interpolated string. The structural sanity check below (drive letter, colon,
    separator, no control characters) is defense in depth over the resolver's own cross-check
    against the frozen consent table; it is NOT what makes the embedding injection-safe -- the
    base64 encoding is, regardless of what this check would have allowed through.
    Throws a distinguishable ATTR3_PRESENCE_* token on any refusal; returns a pscustomobject
    describing the emitted job otherwise.
    On Bachelor, the emitted job checks each part with every filesystem call wrapped in its own
    try/catch (round 4), reporting an honest per-part status -- PASS, NOT_FOUND, ACCESS_DENIED,
    UNREADABLE, LENGTH_MISMATCH, SHA256_MISMATCH or TARGET_PATH_UNSAFE (round 4: the same
    target-chain reparse-point check Attr3FootageStageJob.psm1's own emitted job applies, run
    here before a single byte of the part is ever read) -- and an overall result of
    FOOTAGE_PRESENT (exit 0), FOOTAGE_ABSENT (exit 1), FOOTAGE_MISMATCH (exit 2) or
    FOOTAGE_INDETERMINATE (exit 3); see the mapping documented above the overall-result block in
    the job template below for the exact rule. No exception's own text ever reaches this job's
    output, since it can contain the part's real path.
