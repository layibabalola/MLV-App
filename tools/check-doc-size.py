"""Portable documentation size checker.

Ported into MLV-App with the repo-specific parts confined to the CONFIG block
below. The machinery below END CONFIG is deliberately unmodified so findings stay
comparable across projects in the fleet.

Budgets are assigned by ROLE, not by directory, because the cost of a large file
is proportional to how often it is read. An entry point every cold session opens
is expensive at 12 KB; a spec one implementer reads once is not expensive at
30 KB.

Companion check: this script measures SIZE only. Splitting a doc in this repo can
also break closeout, because `tools/repo_hygiene/brokered_closeout.py` and its
test suite assert exact substrings against CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and several docs/
files. That is guarded separately by `tools/docs/check_pinned_tokens.py`, which
has no equivalent in the portable machinery. Run both.

Exit status:
  0  no hard-cap breach (soft-cap warnings may still be printed)
  1  at least one hard-cap breach
  2  bad usage, or the git listing failed
