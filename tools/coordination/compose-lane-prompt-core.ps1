.SYNOPSIS
    Pure composition logic for turning a fields-*.md or a full card-*.md into a dispatch-ready
    lane prompt. DOT-SOURCED by Compose-LanePrompt.ps1 (the tracked, hashed CLI) and by
    Invoke-Workstream.ps1 (which needs the resolved branch name, not just prompt text, before it
    can create the lane's worktree).

.DESCRIPTION
    THE COMPOSER CONTRACT lives in product-card-TEMPLATE.md's own trailing HTML comment (the
    ratified manifest surface) - this file implements it, it does not restate it. Two shapes:

      FIELDS FILE (basename starts with 'fields-'): the labeled fields it carries are substituted
      into product-card-TEMPLATE.md. Any line matching ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*: at column 0 whose label is
      not in the known set is an UNKNOWN FIELD and composition is REFUSED - nothing is silently
      dropped.

      FULL CARD (anything else, e.g. card-*.md): the prose is already complete; only the runtime
      placeholders the card actually carries are substituted (WORKDIR, BASE_SHA, RUNDIR, TS, BRANCH,
      PR_STEP). A full card with no {{BRANCH}} token names its branch as a literal string instead
      (`git switch -c <literal>`), which this file extracts so the caller's worktree gets the same
      branch the composed prompt tells the lane to switch to.

    PR_STEP has exactly two ratified literals (plan 0.35): one for ghCapability=lane-can-open-pr,
    one for everything else. Both carry a nested {{BRANCH}}, which is MATERIALISED before PR_STEP is
    inserted into the template - so by the time the general substitution pass runs, PR_STEP is
    already a closed string and one pass is sufficient (equivalent to the contract's "fixed point"
    at convergence).

    NO Set-StrictMode HERE. landing-probe.ps1 already paid for this lesson: a dot-sourced helper
    that turns on strict mode changes its CALLER's semantics just by being consulted.
