# assert-script-currency.ps1 -- refuse to run a board-root script whose checkout is STALE.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# .claude-state/ is gitignored, so the board root is the only checkout that holds it -- and the
# board root routinely sits on a PEER BRANCH (a diag/ or lane branch), not on master. A session
# that runs "pwsh -File <board-root>/tools/coordination/queue-derive.ps1" by absolute path then
# executes whatever version of that script the peer branch happens to carry. That version can be
# months old. The failure is SILENT: the script runs, exits 0, and prints a WRONG ANSWER.
#
# This has recurred at least seven times across sessions (grep, absolute-path invocation, owner-of
# resolving its map from the caller's cwd, importing a pre-fix checker module). Every previous
# mitigation was a document, and documents did not stop it. This one is executable.
#
# POLARITY: fail-CLOSED on proven drift, fail-OPEN on missing infrastructure. We stop only when we
# can positively demonstrate that the file on disk differs from the reference; if git is absent,
# the ref does not exist, or the file is not tracked there, we say nothing and let the caller run.
# A guard that blocks on "I could not check" would be worse than the bug.
#
# USAGE (three lines at the top of a guarded script, after param()):
#   $guard = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'assert-script-currency.ps1'
#   if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $guard) { & $guard -ScriptPath $PSCommandPath }
# A drift THROWS, which propagates out of the child script and terminates the caller.
#
# ESCAPE HATCH: set MLV_ALLOW_STALE_TOOLS=1 when you are deliberately running a modified copy --
# for example while developing a change to the guarded script itself. The refusal message names it.
