# landing-probe.ps1 - ONE definition of "did this card land", dot-sourced by every tool that asks.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SHARED FILE AND NOT A COPY IN EACH CALLER.
# Two tools ask this question: Invoke-Workstream.ps1 (to avoid dispatching a lane on finished
# work) and queue-derive.ps1 (to refuse a typed queue state that disagrees with raw). They must
# not answer it differently. The vocabulary below has ALREADY been widened twice from measured
# misses; a second copy would have been widened once and gone stale, which is this board's most
# frequently paid failure.
#
# WHAT COUNTS, AND WHY THE ASYMMETRY IS LOAD-BEARING.
#   TITLE, behind a landing verb  -> STRONG. "...(lands SIDECAR-FIX-1)".
#   BODY, behind a landing verb   -> STRONG. "Closes OWN-2 and delivers GATE-RESIDUALS-1(b)".
#   BARE MENTION, either place    -> NEAR-MISS. Reported with the PR cited, and NOT treated as a
#                                    landing. A false positive SKIPS genuinely open work, which is
#                                    strictly worse than re-deriving finished work.
#
# THE TITLE IS VERB-GATED TOO, AND THAT WAS A CORRECTION. The title match was originally
# unconditional on the theory that "a maintainer wrote the card id into the merge subject" implies
# a landing. MEASURED 2026-09-05, that theory is false: PR #41 is titled "coordination: reject a
# --timestamp that is not a real instant (ADDRESSES STAMP-APPENDER-1)", and its body says in as
# many words -- "this PR says addresses, not lands: a false landing signal would mark the card done
# and skip remaining work." The author deliberately signalled NOT-LANDED and the probe overrode
# them, skipping an open card. Gating the title on the same verb list costs NOTHING: across all 51
# merged PRs and all 117 queue ids there are exactly three title matches, and the two real landings
# (#23, #38) both read "lands". Widening a match is a decision; this narrows one, which is the safe
# direction of the asymmetry above.
#
# FAIL-OPEN BY CONSTRUCTION. If gh is missing, unauthenticated, offline or slow, this returns
# status 'cannot-determine: <reason>' with NO cards matched. An unreadable signal must never
# silently shrink the board - that is how a queue goes quiet and looks healthy.

# NO Set-StrictMode HERE, DELIBERATELY. This file is DOT-SOURCED, so anything it sets lands in the
# CALLER's scope, not its own. An earlier draft set `-Version Latest` and instantly broke
# queue-derive.ps1, which reads optional queue fields (`$item.priority`) that are legitimately
# absent on many cards -- under Latest that is a terminating error, so a shared helper silently
# changed the semantics of an unrelated script that merely consulted it. A library imposes no
# strictness on its callers; Invoke-Workstream.ps1 sets its own, before dot-sourcing this.

# The landing vocabulary. ONE definition; both the title and body matchers consume it, so they can
# never drift apart either. Tolerates markdown emphasis around the id, and the optional 'card' /
# 'queue item' connector that real PR bodies use ("Closes queue item OWN-1-PRECEDENCE", PR #52).
