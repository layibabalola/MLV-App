# Board lane-health sweep. Writes the health.log line every liveness claim on this board

#
# PROMOTED FROM `.claude-state/coordination/dual-lane/health/sweep-lane-health.ps1` under
# SWEEP-CLASS-1 (Layi authorised 2026-08-08). The original header declared the intent -
# "Tier-A lane-health sweep (untracked; Tier-B promotes a reviewed copy to tools/)" - but
# the promotion had never happened, so the board's most-read instrument lived in a
# gitignored path where `owner-of.ps1` returns `unknown`, `lane-commit` hard-blocks it, and
# no gated range could contain it. It could not be reviewed, only edited.
#
# It is deliberately NOT named `sweep-lane-health.ps1`: that name belongs to the
# machine-readable JSON sweep in this directory, which has its own consumers
# (`run-lane-heartbeat.ps1`, the AGENTS.md contract, `tests/coordination/test_lane_health_contract.py`)
# and a different output format. Two different instruments shared one filename in two
# directories, which is how the card's own line numbers came to point at a file the
# implementer would not have been editing. Both now read ONE class list.
