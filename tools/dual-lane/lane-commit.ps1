# WHAT THE `Dual-Lane:` TRAILER MEANS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT (OWN-2)
#
# -Lane is CALLER-DECLARED. It is validated against the two-value set below and nothing else: no
# caller is identified, challenged, or authenticated. So the `Dual-Lane: <lane>` trailer this script
# writes is a PATH-OWNERSHIP LABEL and a typo-guard -- it records which lane's globs the staged paths
# fall under. It is NOT an authorship attestation and must never be read as one.
#
# This is not hypothetical. Landed commits 48e9cd2f and 90d49ee4 (CDX-3) carry `Dual-Lane: claude`
# on tools/** paths: the codex lane ran -Lane claude and nothing objected, because nothing could.
# The ledger reads as though the claude lane authored them. In a month nobody would remember it did
# not -- which is precisely why the label is written down here rather than inferred later.
#
# Same class as the content-review gate's `Seat:` line, which CLAUDE.md already states "validates a
# CLAIMED identity from the ledger; it does NOT authenticate that actor or session". A control that
# names an identity and authenticates nothing is useful as a guard-rail and dangerous as evidence.
