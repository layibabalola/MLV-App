"""MLV-App PROJECT PreToolUse gate for the never-authorized register (NA-1..NA-10).

Contract
--------
argv   : ``--project-dir <path>`` -- THE VENUE, and nothing else is accepted.
stdin  : exactly ONE JSON object, ``{"tool_name": ..., "tool_input": {...}}``.
exit 0 : ALLOW (nothing on stderr).
exit 2 : DENY, with exactly ONE line on stderr, ``NA-<n>: <reason>``.
exit 2 : fail-CLOSED, with ``hook-error: <detail>`` on stderr, for ANY exception,
         malformed or empty stdin, a non-object payload, a missing ``tool_name``, or an
         UNKNOWN command-line argument (argparse rejects extras; they are never silently
         accepted, because an argument this hook does not understand may be the venue
         under a name it no longer reads).

This is the PROJECT hook described by ``never-authorized.json`` (schema v25) and by
``prompts/v2/card-TOOL-HOOK-ENFORCE-1.md``.  It is NOT the global machine hook
``~/.claude/hooks/check-continuity-boundaries.py``, which is shared by every project on
this machine and fails OPEN.  This one fails CLOSED and is tracked on the same ref as the
tree it guards -- a hook is (interpreter x script x REGISTRATION), and only a tracked
script can travel with the worktree it governs.

THE VENUE RIDES ON ARGV, NOT ON THE ENVIRONMENT (O126)
------------------------------------------------------
``--project-dir`` is substituted by Claude Code from ``${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`` in the
REGISTERED command string, so its value is fixed by ``.claude/settings.json`` and no tool
call can set it.  The environment variable of that name was MEASURED ABSENT from real hook
processes on this machine (``.hook-invocations.log``: null in 17/17), which is why the
previous revision's venue test -- which read it from ``os.environ`` -- silently never
fired.  This hook therefore NEVER reads ``CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`` from its environment; the
name appears below only as one of the five NA-3 O129 names whose PERSISTENT assignment is
denied.  Three rules key on the venue, and all three fail closed when it is missing, a
worktree value, or empty -- ABSENT is never "unknown, assume the hub":

  * NA-2 exception (iv), O124 -- writes (create, extend or amend, ANY length, by
    ``Write``/``Edit``/``NotebookEdit`` or by a shell truncating write) to the four
    ratified manifest surfaces ``<board>/.claude-state/coordination/dual-lane/``
    ``{DEFINITIVE-FIX-PLAN-*.md, never-authorized.json, Start-EditingLane.ps1,
    prompts/v2/**}``.  Delete/move of a surface stays DENIED at every venue.
  * NA-2 exception (i), S105 -- the dedicated 0.2 enable act.  A worktree lane's hook
    evaluates the SAME absolute board paths, so without this test it would admit the
    canonical compound the moment the six receipts exist, before the hub has verified $R
    or installed the task.
  * NA-2, S125 -- the PRE-FLIGHT ARTIFACT act, the SECOND dedicated act: a ``Write`` of
    exactly ``<board>\\.claude-state\\coordination\\dual-lane\\receipts\\``
    ``0.2-enable-preflight-input.json`` is allowed only at the board venue (and only onto
    an absent target, with the exact stdin JSON of a currently valid canonical enable as
    its content -- see THE PRE-FLIGHT ARTIFACT ACT below).
  * NA-10, O129 (hub extension) -- a lane editing its own gate.  Any write to
    ``.claude/settings.json``, ``.claude/settings.local.json`` or
    ``tools/hooks/mlv-never-authorized.py``, UNDER ANY ROOT, is denied away from the board
    venue: this hook is re-read on every tool call, so a lane's edit of its registration or
    of this script would take effect on its next call.  Hook evolution stays hub-authored.

Environment inputs (all optional; every default keeps the rule fail-closed on the real
machine, and only the test supplies overrides, so the falsifier table is host-independent)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MLV_LANE_PROMPT             path to the lane's prompt file; NA-4 reads its
                            ``CLIP_OR_NONE:`` line, matched ``^(- )?CLIP_OR_NONE:``
                            (full cards carry the label as a bullet, fields files at
                            column 0).  Unset => any ``*.mlv`` outside the tracked
                            fixtures is DENIED.
MLV_BOARD_ROOT              default ``C:\\!Layi Wkspc\\MLV-App``.  The venue is compared
                            against THIS.

MLV_REQUIRED_CHECKS_SNAPSHOT
                            default ``<board>\\.claude-state\\coordination\\dual-lane\\
                            receipts\\required-checks-live.jsonl``.  NA-9 reads the LAST
                            non-empty row.  Absent, unparseable, or a malformed row
                            anywhere => every protection mutation is DENIED.
MLV_HOOK_DRYRUN=1           print the decision on stdout; the exit code is unchanged.

THE CANONICAL 0.2 ENABLE COMPOUND (O128) -- the ONE shell write the receipt paths admit::

    $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; $r = '<json>'; Set-Content -LiteralPath '<receipt>'
    -Value $r -NoNewline -Encoding utf8 -ErrorAction Stop; if ((Get-Content -LiteralPath
    '<receipt>' -Raw -ErrorAction Stop) -cne $r) { throw
    'enable-receipt-write-verification-failed' }; Remove-Item -LiteralPath '<marker>'
    -ErrorAction Stop

The LEADING preference statement is load-bearing and was measured so: with a receipt path
on an unresolvable drive the provider dynamic parameters go unbound, ``-ErrorAction`` goes
unbound WITH them, and the rev-19 shape exits 0 having deleted the marker with no receipt
written.  ``$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`` closes that class; the rev-19 shape (no
leading preference) is now just another non-canonical input.

ONE FIXED NOTATION FOR EVERY ``recordedUtc``, AND THE NEWEST IS THE PARSED VALUE (O141)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every ``recordedUtc`` this hook READS or VALIDATES carries exactly ONE notation --
``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ``: whole seconds, uppercase ``Z``, no fractional part, no offset,
and a real calendar date (the regex settles the notation, ``strptime`` settles the
calendar).  That is register v21's wording, and it covers every ``execution-control-*.json``
the enable act considers AND the enable literal's own ``enabledUtc`` and ``recordedUtc``.
The sixth commit accepted an OPTIONAL fractional part in the literal and never checked a
receipt's stamp at all; both are narrowed here, so a fractional literal stamp is now DENY.

WHY, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSERTED.  The sixth commit selected the newest
execution-control receipt by comparing the raw STRINGS, and the hub reproduced the
consequence on that very commit: with ``0.6`` stamped ``2026-09-06T16:00:00Z`` and ``0.7``
stamped ``2026-09-06T16:00:00.500000Z``, ``'2026-09-06T16:00:00Z' >
'2026-09-06T16:00:00.500000Z'`` is TRUE in Python -- ``Z`` is 0x5A and ``.`` is 0x2E -- so
the STALE 0.6 was selected as newest and the one-shot enable could fire against it.  Two
arms close that class, and they are load-bearing in different ways:

  * a receipt whose ``recordedUtc`` does not conform is INVALID.  The newest is then
    UNDECIDABLE and the whole exception fails closed, naming the offending FILE -- never
    silently skipped, never treated as older.  A skipped receipt is one the board cannot
    see, and the enable would then be taken against a set nobody enumerated.
  * the newest is chosen by the PARSED value (``datetime.strptime`` of the pinned
    notation), never by a byte comparison, and an EXACT TIE between two candidates makes
    the newest UNDECIDABLE too -- DENY, naming BOTH files.  Note what this does and does
    not buy: with the notation pinned to a FIXED WIDTH, lexical order and chronological
    order coincide, so it is the VALIDATION that makes the mixed-notation case come out
    right, not the parse.  The parse is what makes "the same instant" detectable as
    EQUALITY rather than as a byte difference, and it is what the register pins.

``_kill_switch_receipts_ok`` is the ONE selection site and hands its answer down to the
literal check, so "which receipt is newest" has exactly one answer in this hook.

THE SIX GATE RECEIPTS VALIDATE AGAINST A SCHEMA TABLE (S118, register v21)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to the seventh commit, "validate" meant ``json.load`` returned something that was not
``None``.  ``{}`` is not ``None``, and the hub reproduced the consequence on the sixth
commit: FIVE EMPTY OBJECTS beside an ``execution-control-forged.json`` carrying only the
three provenance keys ALLOWED the canonical enable, exit 0.  The gate that spends the one
ratified authorization was a file-existence test wearing a schema's name.

The ONE table is plan 1.3 step 5, implemented here as ``KILL_SWITCH_RECEIPT_SCHEMAS`` plus
the chain rules.  Every gate receipt parses as JSON, is a NON-EMPTY object, and carries
``recordedUtc`` in the pinned notation above.  Value classes: ``sha256`` = 64 lowercase hex;
``sha`` = 40 lowercase hex; ``path`` = a file that EXISTS (absolute, else relative to the
board root); ``url`` = begins ``https://github.com/layibabalola/MLV-App/``; ``int`` = a
non-negative integer and a ``bool`` is NOT one; ``list`` = a JSON array.  Per receipt:

  * ``0.18-roadmap-parity.json``  queueArmResultSha256 (sha256); composedPromptPath,
    prChecksPath, prReviewPath, solVerdictPath (paths).
  * ``0.4b-required-checks.json`` headSha (sha); preContexts (list); postContexts (exactly
    the canonical five strings, containing ``Batch Compile``); snapshotRowSha256 (sha256).
  * ``0.4c-demoted.json``         headSha, mergeSha (shas); runUrl (url); solVerdictPath (path).
  * ``0.6-ratio-guard.json``      mergeSha (sha); firstReading (present and non-empty);
    solVerdictPath (path).
  * ``0.5-factory-frozen.json``   queueSha256, dryRunDiffSha256 (sha256); frozenCount (int);
    scopelessIds (list).
  * ``execution-control-<step>.json`` for <step> in {0.1, 0.35, 0.4c-i, 0.4b-i, 0.6, 0.7} --
    THE SIX CHAIN NAMES AND NO OTHER: ``reviewedHeadSha`` (sha -- the PR HEAD the second
    key reviewed BEFORE the merge); ``mergeSha`` (sha -- the post-merge commit the
    receipt's hashes were taken at, S123); ``solVerdictPath`` (path) whose TERMINAL JSON
    block carries ``verdict`` APPROVE and ``subject_sha`` equal to that ``reviewedHeadSha``
    (S120); ``hashes``, an object whose KEY SET is EXACTLY the step's
    fixed set in ``EXECUTION_CONTROL_HASH_TABLE`` and whose values are all sha256 (S120 --
    a missing or an extra key is INVALID); ``fixedSetEqualityProof``, the literal
    ``<reviewedHeadSha>=<mergeSha>:<digest>`` whose two shas EQUAL this receipt's own and
    whose digest EQUALS the sha256 of the sorted ``<sha256>  <path>`` lines recomputed from
    its own ``hashes`` (O172); 0.1 additionally ``composerStatus`` ==
    ``not-yet-created`` plus ``composedPromptPath``, ``prChecksPath`` and ``prReviewPath``
    (paths); 0.35 additionally those three paths; and from 0.35 on
    ``roadmapParityReceiptSha256`` EQUAL to the sha256 of ``0.18-roadmap-parity.json``'s
    bytes on disk, ``queueSha256`` (shape only, carried forward) and ``productLiveCount``
    exactly 15.  Any OTHER ``execution-control-*.json`` present is INVALID and fails the
    exception closed by name -- the candidate set is an ENUMERATION, not the glob the
    forged receipt walked in through.

The SELECTED control receipt is ``execution-control-0.7.json`` when a valid one exists, else
``execution-control-0.6.json``, and the parsed-newest valid chain receipt must BE the
selected one: a valid 0.6 stamped later than a valid 0.7 is a CHAIN VIOLATION (undecidable),
and the selected receipt absent is DENY.  Every refusal names the FILE and the KEY -- or the
value class -- that failed.

STRICT UNDECIDABILITY (O152).  A chain receipt that is PRESENT but invalid -- a missing or
non-conforming stamp, a missing provenance key, a malformed value -- is NEVER silently
excluded.  It makes the newest UNDECIDABLE and the act fails closed naming it.  Exclusion
was the amendment's proposal and is rejected here, because it re-opens O141's hazard in a
new shape: an invalid 0.7 beside a valid 0.6 would silently select the STALE 0.6, and the
one-shot enable would fire against a superseded receipt.  Recovery from an undecidable set
-- a malformed receipt or an exact tie -- is a NON-shrinking ``Write``-tool rewrite of the
offending receipt carrying a conforming stamp and every required key, which the receipts
carve-out allows; never a delete.  This whole arm is a PURE DECISION: it opens files for
reading and hashes one of them, and writes nothing anywhere.

THE SECOND KEY'S APPROVAL, THE FIXED HASH SET, AND THE RE-HASH (S120/O158/O159, register v22)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to the eighth commit a chain receipt validated with ANY non-empty ``hashes`` object and
no review at all: a receipt carrying one hashed path and no reviewer's verdict was a
complete receipt.  The gate the whole chain exists to close is "the tooling that runs the
board is the tooling the second key approved", and that reading of ``hashes`` proved neither
half.  Three arms close it:

  * S120 -- ``reviewedHeadSha`` (40 lowercase hex, the PR head the second key reviewed
    BEFORE the merge -- see S123 below) and ``solVerdictPath``, a file that exists whose
    TERMINAL JSON block -- the last ```json
    fenced block, else the last top-level JSON object in the file, which is how the
    ``sol-review-PR-TEMPLATE`` ends -- parses to an object carrying ``verdict`` ==
    ``APPROVE`` and ``subject_sha`` == that ``reviewedHeadSha``.  Absent, unreadable, a
    block that does not parse, a verdict that is not APPROVE, or an approval of a DIFFERENT
    head: INVALID, and under O152 that makes the newest undecidable.  An APPROVE of some
    other sha is the second key's approval of something else, not of this head.
  * S120 -- the ``hashes`` KEY SET is EXACTLY the step's required set, and the six sets
    live in ONE table, ``EXECUTION_CONTROL_HASH_TABLE``, written the way the plan writes
    them (BASE, then what each step adds) so the plan and the code are compared by eye in
    one place.  A missing key is a file the step did not measure; an EXTRA key is a file no
    step landed, which is how a receipt would come to vouch for a script nobody reviewed.
  * O158 -- at the enable act, AFTER the selection and the venue test, the hook RE-HASHES
    every file of the SELECTED receipt's FIXED set in the board root and compares each to
    the receipt's value.  The fixed set, never merely the keys present: the set to walk is
    the table's, and a file of that set ABSENT from the board root is a refusal naming the
    path, as is a digest that differs.  This is the one arm that reads the board's TOOLING
    rather than its receipts, and it is what makes "the receipt validated" mean "the board
    still matches it".

O159 is a hub PROCEDURE, not hook logic, and it is recorded here because the hook's strict
rule is what makes it necessary.  When the receipt that has to be rewritten is
``0.18-roadmap-parity.json`` -- whose sha256 every chain receipt from 0.35 on carries -- the
same non-shrinking ``Write`` rewrite is followed, IN THE SAME HUB STEP, by a non-shrinking
rewrite of every chain receipt from 0.35 on, re-pointing ``roadmapParityReceiptSha256`` to
the repaired file's new digest while ``queueSha256`` and ``productLiveCount`` stay as they
were: the ONE amendment to "carried forward unchanged".  The hook needs no new arm for it --
it binds every chain receipt to the 0.18 bytes on disk already -- which is exactly why a
repair that re-points all but one receipt is refused naming the one left behind, and the
suite measures both halves.

THE TWO SHAS OF A CONTROL RECEIPT (S123, register v23)
------------------------------------------------------
``reviewedHeadSha`` is the PR HEAD the second key reviewed BEFORE the merge -- the sha the
verdict's ``subject_sha`` binds to.  It is not the merge sha and can never be: a GitHub
merge lands a DIFFERENT commit, so a receipt recording the merge commit under this key
could never carry a verdict of it, and the ninth commit's one-sha reading, applied to a
real merge, would have made every post-merge control receipt INVALID.  ``mergeSha`` is the
SECOND required key -- 40 lowercase hex, the post-merge fork/master commit at which the
receipt's ``hashes`` were taken.  Absent or malformed on ANY of the six chain receipts is
INVALID, the refusal names the file and the key, and under O152 that makes the newest
undecidable.

What this hook does NOT judge, and why.  It never denies ``mergeSha == reviewedHeadSha``:
a rebase or a fast-forward lands the reviewed commit itself as the tip, and the hook does
not know the merge method -- shape only.  It makes NO git call: the equality of the step's
fixed set at the two shas (``git show <sha>:<path>`` piped to sha256, each path, at both
shas) is a HUB assertion made BEFORE the receipt is written, outside this hook.  A mismatch
there means the merge carried something the review did not see, and no control receipt is
written until sol has reviewed the merge commit itself.  The hook checks shape and the
subject binding only, never git (S123).

THE FIXED-SET EQUALITY PROOF (O172, register v25)
-------------------------------------------------
The hub's assertion that a step's fixed set hashed EQUAL at ``reviewedHeadSha`` and at
``mergeSha`` was, up to the tenth commit, recorded nowhere the hook could see: a receipt
whose two shas were well-formed validated whether or not the hub had run it.  Every one of
the six chain receipts now carries ``fixedSetEqualityProof``, the literal
``<reviewedHeadSha>=<mergeSha>:<digest>`` -- two 40-character lowercase hex shas joined by
``=``, then ``:`` and a 64-character lowercase hex sha256 -- which the hub writes only after
the assertion succeeded.  The hook validates its SHAPE, that its first sha EQUALS the
receipt's ``reviewedHeadSha`` and its second the receipt's ``mergeSha``, and that its digest
EQUALS the sha256 of the sorted ``<sha256>  <path>`` lines RECOMPUTED from the receipt's OWN
``hashes`` object -- ``_fixed_set_digest``, the ONE canonicalisation: one line per entry of
``hashes``, the digest, TWO spaces, the board-relative path (the shape ``sha256sum`` prints);
the lines sorted as plain strings (so by digest first, the order ``sort`` gives ``sha256sum``
output); joined by a single LF with NO trailing newline; UTF-8; sha256; lowercase hex.  Pure
recomputation -- no git, no file read -- so a proof pasted from another receipt, or written
before the hashes were, fails by VALUE.  Absent, malformed, a sha that does not match, or a
digest that does not match is INVALID; the refusal names the file, the key and which part
failed; and under O152 that makes the newest undecidable.  The arm runs AFTER the ``hashes``
arm, because the digest is recomputed from that object.  What the hook still does NOT judge
is unchanged from S123: the equality itself is the hub's git assertion, and what is checked
here is that the attestation is bound to THIS receipt's shas and THIS receipt's hashes.

THE PRE-FLIGHT ARTIFACT ACT (S125, register v25)
------------------------------------------------
Before typing the enable the hub writes the EXACT hook-stdin JSON of the final board-path
compound -- ``{"tool_name":"PowerShell","tool_input":{"command":"<the compound>"}}`` -- to
``$D\\receipts\\0.2-enable-preflight-input.json`` with the ``Write`` tool and runs the live
hook on that file under ``MLV_HOOK_DRYRUN=1`` (S104).  That content names BOTH enable paths,
and the register says any other input naming both paths is DENIED; the hub measured on the
tenth commit that the Write was ALLOWED anyway -- by the receipts carve-out, as a create
under ``$D\\receipts\\**`` -- and that the same content written to ``notes.json``, under
``fleet-runs/`` and from a worktree venue was allowed too.  S125 closes that text/code gap
BY RULE, as the SECOND dedicated act, evaluated before generic content attribution and after
the venue test: a ``Write`` (that tool name exactly) whose normalised path is exactly the
artifact's is ALLOWED only when the venue is the board root (the enable act's own test), the
target does not exist on disk, and the content parses as exactly ONE JSON object whose
``tool_name`` is ``PowerShell`` and whose ``tool_input.command`` is the canonical enable
compound the enable act would accept RIGHT NOW against the CURRENT six receipts --
``_enable_act_why``, the SAME validation (the semantic literal, the receipt schemas, the
chain selection, the O158 re-hash) on an inner context, performing nothing.  It writes
evidence only and authorizes no delete.  Any other path carrying that content
(``fleet-runs/`` included), a worktree venue, an existing target, a malformed or
multi-object content, an inner ``tool_name`` other than ``PowerShell``, or a non-canonical
or semantically invalid command is DENIED, the refusal naming the file and the reason.
GENERIC CONTENT ATTRIBUTION then applies to every other ``Write``/``Edit``/``NotebookEdit``:
content naming both enable paths, or carrying the marker under a delete verb, written to
ANY other path is DENIED -- the rule the register already stated -- while the receipts
carve-out keeps every OTHER create-or-extend under ``$D\\receipts\\**``.
``MLV_HOOK_DRYRUN=1`` prints the decision for this act exactly as for the enable act.

THE ENABLE LITERAL IS VALIDATED SEMANTICALLY, NOT FOR PRESENCE (S112, register v21)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to rev 21 this hook only checked that the compound's JSON literal was an object carrying
five NON-EMPTY STRINGS with ``state == "enabling"``.  Five strings of ``"x"`` passed.  So the
receipt whose PRESENCE spends the one-shot authorization (S98) -- the only durable record of
which execution-control receipt the enable was taken against -- could be written with a
receipt name and a digest that named nothing, and the gate would still open.  A receipt that
does not bind to the board it was taken on is a receipt of nothing.

The literal is now bound to the board, in this order, so a near-miss is attributable to the
ONE field that failed:

  * the five keys are present, non-empty strings (unchanged), and ``state == "enabling"``;
  * ``enabledUtc`` and ``recordedUtc`` carry the ONE pinned notation above --
    ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ``, whole seconds, uppercase ``Z``, no fraction, no offset (O141).
    The trailing ``Z`` is REQUIRED: a bare stamp is not a UTC stamp, ``+00:00`` is an
    OFFSET, which is a different notation and is refused rather than normalised, and a
    fractional part -- which the sixth commit accepted here -- is refused too, because ONE
    notation everywhere is what makes the literal and the receipts comparable at all;
  * ``executionControlReceipt`` equals the BASENAME of the NEWEST valid execution-control
    receipt -- selected by ``_kill_switch_receipts_ok`` above, the SAME selection that
    decides whether the exception is open at all, never a second implementation of it.  A
    path (``receipts/execution-control-0.7.json``) is not a basename and is refused;
  * ``executionControlSha256`` equals the LOWERCASE hex SHA-256 of THAT FILE's bytes on
    disk.  Uppercase, another file's digest and a truncated digest are all refused by exact
    string comparison -- a digest that has to be normalised before it matches was not the
    digest of that file.

The literal arm runs LAST, after the receipt state, the venue and the shape, so a lane is
never told that its literal was well-formed and only the board-rooted actor ever sees the
expected digest in a refusal line.

Stdlib only.  Deterministic: no subprocess, no clock, no network -- ``datetime`` is imported
to PARSE the pinned stamps (the literal's two and every receipt's ``recordedUtc`` -- O141),
never to read the current time, and ``hashlib`` to hash
a file already on disk and to recompute the O172 digest from a receipt's own ``hashes``.
The worktree root is derived from this file's own location
(``parents[2]``) rather than from ``git rev-parse`` in the session cwd -- it needs no
subprocess, it is the copy that actually governs the lane, and it is at least as closed as
the cwd reading.

    decided whether the exception is open at all.  A second implementation of "newest by
    ``recordedUtc``" living next to this one is a second answer waiting to disagree with it:
    the register names one newest receipt, so the hook computes it once.  It is ``""``
    whenever ``ok`` is False -- there is no newest to name when the set does not validate.

    Reached ONLY from the canonical dedicated act below (S99/O118).  It is no longer a
    standing key that any input naming the marker under a delete verb can turn: a delete
    outside the canonical compound is refused before this is ever consulted.

    S118 -- "VALIDATE" IS THE SCHEMA TABLE, NOT ``json.load(...) is not None``.  Each of the
    five fixed receipts is judged against its row of ``KILL_SWITCH_RECEIPT_SCHEMAS``:
    required keys, value classes, and ``recordedUtc`` in the pinned notation.  An EMPTY
    OBJECT is INVALID -- which is the whole point, because the hub's reproduction on the
    sixth commit was five ``{}`` receipts beside ``execution-control-forged.json`` carrying
    only the provenance keys, and that set ALLOWED the one-shot enable.  Every refusal names
    the FILE and the KEY (or the value class) that failed.

    The execution-control arm's candidate set is the SIX CHAIN NAMES and no other; any other
    ``execution-control-*.json`` present is INVALID and fails the exception closed by name.
    Each chain receipt carries ``reviewedHeadSha`` (the PR head reviewed BEFORE the merge)
    and ``mergeSha`` (the post-merge commit its hashes were taken at -- S123, shape only,
    never compared to each other and never to git), a ``solVerdictPath`` whose terminal
    JSON block is the second key's APPROVE of exactly the REVIEWED head (S120), ``hashes``
    whose KEY SET is exactly its step's fixed set with sha256 values (S120), its step's own
    keys, and,
    from 0.35 on, ``roadmapParityReceiptSha256`` EQUAL to the sha256 of
    ``0.18-roadmap-parity.json`` as it is on disk, a well-formed ``queueSha256``, and
    ``productLiveCount`` exactly 15.  The O158 re-hash of the SELECTED receipt's fixed set
    runs in ``_enable_act_allowed``, after the venue test, because its refusal names what
    drifted in the board root and that is the board-rooted actor's to see.

    O141/O152 pin the ORDER and the STRICTNESS.  A receipt LACKING ``recordedUtc`` is INVALID
    (O105) and its mere presence makes the newest undecidable, so the whole exception fails
    closed; so does a receipt whose ``recordedUtc`` is not the ONE pinned notation
    ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ``, and that refusal NAMES the offending file -- a non-conforming
    stamp is never silently skipped and never treated as older.  O152 generalises that to
    EVERY schema fault: a chain receipt that is PRESENT but invalid is never excluded, it
    makes the newest UNDECIDABLE, because excluding it would let an invalid 0.7 beside a
    valid 0.6 select the STALE 0.6.  Recovery is a NON-shrinking ``Write`` rewrite of the
    offending receipt, never a delete.  The order is the order of the PARSED values, never
    of the raw bytes, and an EXACT TIE between two candidates is undecidable too: DENY,
    naming BOTH files.

    The SELECTED receipt is a NAME -- ``execution-control-0.7.json`` when a valid one exists,
    else ``execution-control-0.6.json`` -- and the parsed-newest valid chain receipt must BE
    that one.  A valid 0.6 stamped later than a valid 0.7 is a CHAIN VIOLATION, undecidable
    rather than a new answer; the selected receipt absent is DENY.

    S98 -- THE ENABLE IS ONE-SHOT, and this is the first arm because it is the decisive
    one.  Exception (i) opens only while ``receipts/0.2-loop-enabled.json`` is ABSENT.  0.2
    creates that receipt in the same guarded action as the delete, so once it exists the
    single ratified authorization has been spent: a RE-ARMED marker (creating the kill
    switch is always allowed, exception (iii)) cannot then be deleted again without a NEWLY
    ratified authorization.  Without this arm the six receipts would be a standing key --
    valid forever, re-usable on every re-arm -- which is a gate that opens once and never
    closes.  Fail-closed: PRESENCE of the path is enough; it is not parsed, so an
    unreadable or truncated enable receipt still refuses.

# ------------------------------------------- NA-2 exception (i): ONE DEDICATED ACT
#
# S99/O118.  Generic NA-2 attribution applies a command's ACT SET to EVERY path in its
# text, so the register's own canonical enable -- which creates the receipt AND deletes
# the marker in one input -- reads as a DELETE of a receipt and is refused (the
# Claude-family ratifier measured 8/8 formulations denied).  The resolution is not to
# loosen the attribution, which would also admit `Remove-Item <receipt>` on its own: the
# hook recognises the canonical compound as ONE dedicated act, BEFORE attribution runs,
# and the delete of the marker is authorized ONLY inside that act.  Everything else that
# deletes the marker -- a bare delete, a re-ordered compound, a different write cmdlet --
# is DENIED, receipts or no receipts.
#
# S101 -- THE CANONICAL SHAPE IS THE FAIL-CLOSED ONE, AND ONLY IT (0.05 fourth review
# delta).  `Set-Content` raises a NON-terminating error by default: on a full disk, a
# denied ACL or a missing parent the write fails, the pipeline continues, and the rev-18
# shape's `Remove-Item` then disarms the kill switch with `0.2-loop-enabled.json` ABSENT.
# That is not a degraded enable, it is the never-authorized act with a receipt-shaped alibi
# -- and worse, the S98 one-shot never closes, because the receipt whose presence spends
# the authorization was never written.  So the register now pins `-ErrorAction Stop` on
# BOTH acts and a read-back `throw` between them, and this hook matches ONLY that form.
# The rev-18 shape (no `-ErrorAction Stop`, no read-back) is NOT a grandfathered enable: it
# is an ordinary non-canonical input naming both paths, refused below with S101 named in
# the line so the operator is told WHICH degree of freedom closed.  Measured: the compound
# against a receipt path under a nonexistent directory exits non-zero at the write and
# LEAVES THE MARKER IN PLACE (the S101 acceptance, run for real against pwsh in
# `EnableCompoundIsFailClosedTests`).
#
# O128 -- THE COMPOUND NOW OPENS WITH `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` (0.05 FIFTH review
# delta), because `-ErrorAction Stop` turned out NOT to be the load-bearing arm for one
# whole failure class.  The hub measured the rev-19 shape in pwsh 7.6.5: a missing parent
# directory, a read-only target and a directory target each exit 1 with the marker PRESENT
# -- but a receipt path on an UNRESOLVABLE DRIVE exits 0, writes nothing, and DELETES THE
# MARKER.  The reason is binding, not writing: when the provider cannot resolve the drive
# the cmdlet's provider dynamic parameters never bind, `-ErrorAction` goes unbound with
# them, and the statement's failure is not governed by the parameter that was supposed to
# govern it.  A preference variable is not a parameter and cannot come unbound, so the
# leading statement closes the class the three parameter-level arms cannot reach.  With it,
# all four measured failures exit non-zero with the marker in place.  The rev-19 shape (no
# leading preference) is now what the rev-18 shape became under S101: an ordinary
# non-canonical input naming both paths, refused with O128 named in the line.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED READINGS OF THE CANONICAL SHAPE (recorded, 0.05 third, fourth and fifth review
# deltas).  The register pins the form character-for-character except whitespace, so every
# degree of freedom it does not name is refused rather than guessed:
#   * PowerShell tool ONLY -- the register writes "the canonical compound form" in
#     PowerShell; the same text arriving as a Bash input is not it.
#   * `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` FIRST, before anything else in the input.  The
#     preference NAME and VALUE are compared case-insensitively, because PowerShell resolves
#     a variable name and an `ActionPreference` enum member that way and a case difference
#     therefore changes no behaviour -- the same reading already applied to the two
#     `-ErrorAction Stop` arms.  Any OTHER value (`Continue`, `SilentlyContinue`) is refused:
#     it is the value that closes the drive class, not the statement.
#   * The variable is `$r` (case-insensitively, as PowerShell resolves it) in ALL THREE
#     places -- the assignment, `-Value`, and the read-back's `-cne` operand -- and nothing
#     else.  A verification that compares a DIFFERENT variable verifies nothing.
#   * `Set-Content -LiteralPath <receipt> -Value $r -NoNewline -Encoding utf8
#     -ErrorAction Stop` exactly: not `-Path`, not a reordered, dropped or extra parameter,
#     not `Out-File`, not a redirect.
#   * The read-back names THE SAME receipt path as the write, everywhere the path appears.
#     Reading a different file back proves the write succeeded somewhere else, which is
#     precisely the failure S101 exists to catch.
#   * The `throw` string is `enable-receipt-write-verification-failed`, compared
#     CASE-SENSITIVELY: the register pins a literal, and a literal that differs is a
#     different act -- the receipt of a halt is what a later reader greps for.
#   * `Remove-Item -LiteralPath <marker> -ErrorAction Stop` -- without it a delete failure
#     is swallowed and the enable reports success it did not have.
#   * Single-quoted literals containing no quote of their own; a PowerShell-escaped `''`
#     inside one fails the shape and is refused.
#   * `;` between the five statements, and NOTHING before, between or after them.
# The cost of each reading is a visible DENY on a near-miss, one line to fix.  The cost of
# the other reading is a silent ALLOW of a marker delete, which is the act itself.
#
# S112 -- AND THE LITERAL ITSELF IS READ, NOT COUNTED (0.05 SIXTH review delta).  Every
# reading above is about the SHAPE of the compound; until this delta the JSON it carries was
# checked only for five non-empty strings, so `{"state":"enabling","enabledUtc":"x",
# "executionControlReceipt":"x","executionControlSha256":"x","recordedUtc":"x"}` opened the
# gate and wrote itself down as the receipt of record.  The literal is now BOUND TO THE
# BOARD -- the newest execution-control receipt's basename, that file's lowercase sha256, and
# two stamps in the ONE pinned notation (O141) -- in `_enable_literal_ok` below.  A receipt
# that names nothing is not a lesser receipt; it is the enable act with a receipt-shaped
# alibi, the same failure class S101 closed at the write and S98 closed on re-arm.

    ``why`` is the FIRST condition that failed, in this order -- S98 (the receipt is already
    present) first, because a spent authorization settles the input before anything else is
    read; then the receipt set; then the venue; then the O158 re-hash; then the literal.
    ONE validation, TWO callers: ``_enable_act_allowed`` raises ``why`` as the enable's
    refusal, and the S125 pre-flight artifact act quotes it, because the command the
    artifact records must be the compound the enable act would accept RIGHT NOW against the
    same six receipts -- a second implementation would be a second answer.

    S105/O126 -- THE ENABLE ACT IS VENUE-BOUND, and the venue is checked AFTER the receipt
    state and BEFORE the literal.  After, because S98's answer is a standing fact about the
    board that is true at every venue and must be reported as such: an operator holding a
    spent authorization needs to be told the authorization is spent, not that they are in
    the wrong directory.  Before the literal, because a lane may not be told that its
    literal was well-formed.  Without this test the exception is not venue-bound at all: a
    worktree lane's hook evaluates the SAME absolute board paths and would admit the
    compound the moment the six receipts exist -- before the hub has verified $R or
    installed the task (S105).

    O158 -- THE SELECTED RECEIPT'S FIXED SET IS RE-HASHED IN THE BOARD ROOT, after the venue
    and before the literal.  After the venue, because the refusal names which board file
    drifted and to what, which is the board-rooted actor's to see and not a lane's; before
    the literal, because a literal naming a receipt the board no longer matches is a receipt
    of a board that no longer exists, and the operator should be told about the drift, not
    about the digest of a file whose own digests are stale.

    S112 -- THE LITERAL IS VALIDATED SEMANTICALLY, and it stays LAST for the same two
    reasons, now load-bearing in a third way: the digest arm's refusal line names the
    EXPECTED digest, which only the board-rooted actor may see, and only the venue test
    ahead of it guarantees that.  ``_kill_switch_receipts_ok`` hands its own selection down

# ------------------------------ NA-2, S125: the PRE-FLIGHT ARTIFACT, the SECOND dedicated act
#
# PRE-FLIGHT (S104): before typing the enable the hub writes the EXACT hook-stdin JSON of the
# final board-path compound -- `{"tool_name":"PowerShell","tool_input":{"command":"<the
# compound>"}}` -- to `$D\receipts\0.2-enable-preflight-input.json` with the `Write` tool,
# records its sha256, and runs the LIVE board's hook on that file under MLV_HOOK_DRYRUN=1, so
# the shape boundary the enable act draws is proven BEFORE the one-shot act rather than
# discovered by it.  That Write carries content naming BOTH enable paths, and the register
# says any other input naming both paths is DENIED -- so on the tenth commit the hub measured
# a TEXT/CODE GAP: the Write was ALLOWED, but by the receipts carve-out (a create under
# `$D\receipts\**`), not by any rule about what it carried; and the same content written to
# `notes.json`, under `fleet-runs/`, and from a worktree venue was ALLOWED too (measured
# again on this repo before this delta: four ALLOWs).  S125 pins the decision BY RULE, as the
# second dedicated act:
#
#   * a `Write` -- that tool name exactly; an `Edit` or `NotebookEdit` of the path is refused
#     as a near-miss of the act, never judged as a carve-out extend -- whose normalised path
#     is EXACTLY the artifact's (derived from MLV_BOARD_ROOT like every enable path, so a
#     scratch root can never match), is ALLOWED only when ALL hold, tested in this order:
#     the venue is the board root (the enable act's own test, S105/O126, for the same
#     reason -- a lane's hook evaluates the same absolute board paths); the target does NOT
#     exist on disk (the act CREATES the artifact; a stale one is the hub's to recover); and
#     the content parses as exactly ONE JSON object whose `tool_name` is `PowerShell` and
#     whose `tool_input.command` is the canonical enable compound the enable act would
#     accept RIGHT NOW -- `_enable_act_why` on an inner context, the SAME validation (the
#     semantic literal, the receipt schemas, the chain selection, the O158 re-hash), never a
#     second one.  It writes evidence only and authorizes no delete: nothing about the
#     marker changes because this act was allowed.
#   * it is evaluated BEFORE generic content attribution and after the venue test, exactly
#     as the enable act is evaluated before generic per-path attribution, and for the same
#     reason: attributing the content's verbs to the paths it names would deny the artifact
#     itself.
#   * GENERIC CONTENT ATTRIBUTION for `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` then follows: content
#     that names BOTH enable paths, or carries the marker under a delete verb, written to
#     ANY other path -- `notes.json`, a fleet-run receipt, a checkpoint, a relative-path copy
#     of the artifact -- is DENIED, naming the path, BEFORE the carve-outs are consulted.  A
#     carve-out is a permission on a PATH; this is a rule about CONTENT, and the carve-out
#     keeps every OTHER create-or-extend under `$D\receipts\**`.
#   * MLV_HOOK_DRYRUN=1 prints the decision for this act exactly as for the enable act: the
#     hook is DECISION-ONLY here as everywhere -- it reads the receipts and the board and
#     writes nothing -- which is what makes the pre-flight probe safe against the live board.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED READINGS (recorded, eleventh delta):
#   * "names a path" is a SUBSTRING test on the payload after `norm`'s reading -- backslashes
#     to slashes, runs of slashes collapsed, case folded -- so the JSON-escaped `C:\\board`
#     the artifact actually carries, a bare `C:/board` and a mixed form are ONE path; and
#     when the payload carries a JSON `\u` escape and parses as JSON, its decoded strings are
#     scanned too, so `\u005c` is not a way around a text matcher.  The EXACT board paths
#     are matched -- the register's "both paths" are the board-absolute ones the compound
#     carries -- and only the NEW content of a payload (`content`, `new_string`,
#     `new_source`): an `Edit` whose `old_string` names both paths is removing them.
#   * The limit is unchanged and restated: an interpreter one-liner, or content encoded in a
#     form no text matcher decodes, is invisible here; the layers behind this rule are the
#     shell arm's S99/O118 refusal of any command that deletes the marker outside the act,
#     and sol's review of every PR diff.

# ---- O129: PERSISTENT-scope assignment of the five names the hook itself is steered by ----
#
# The prefix rule above is about CREDENTIALS.  This one is about the hook's own inputs, and
# the act it denies is narrower and sharper: a PERSISTENT write (`setx`, or
# `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(..., 'User'|'Machine')`) of `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`,
# `MLV_BOARD_ROOT`, `MLV_LANE_PROMPT`, `MLV_REQUIRED_CHECKS_SNAPSHOT` or
# `MLV_CLIP_CACHE_ROOT`.  Those five decide, respectively, the registered venue argument's
# source, the board root every path in NA-2/NA-7/NA-10 is judged against, the clip
# authorization NA-4 reads, the required-checks snapshot NA-9 fails closed without, and the
# cache prefix NA-4 guards.  A persistent write is INHERITED BY EVERY LATER HOOK PROCESS on
# this machine: it does not break a rule, it MOVES the ground the rules stand on, and it
# survives the session that made it.  A plain in-process `$env:MLV_BOARD_ROOT = ...` is NOT
# this act -- it dies with its shell, reaches no hook process, and the test carries an
# explicit ALLOW control for it so the distinction cannot quietly widen into a ban on
# reading or setting these names at all.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED READINGS (recorded, 0.05 fifth review delta):
#   * NAME and SCOPE are matched case-insensitively.  Windows environment variable names are
#     case-insensitive and `[EnvironmentVariableTarget]` parses case-insensitively, so
#     `setx mlv_board_root` is the same act as `setx MLV_BOARD_ROOT`.
#   * The scope is looked for ANYWHERE in the statement after the name, as a quoted literal
#     OR as `[EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User|Machine`, rather than as the strict third
#     positional argument.  Parsing PowerShell argument positions from text is exactly the
#     kind of near-parse that fails open on a line-continuation or a splatted value.
#   * `setx` has NO process-scope form at all -- every `setx` is persistent -- so the name
#     alone is enough there.

# the explicit `status` allowance; this is its OPENING clause, quoted for the two verbs)
#
# so the acts the register never authorizes are `login` and `logout`.  The card's prose
# says only "claude auth", and this hook shipped a `\bclaude\b...\bauth\b` catch-all that
# also denied `claude auth status` -- a READ-ONLY identity check that MUST keep running.
# The board's account-rotation procedure settles CLI-versus-desktop identity with exactly
# `claude auth status --json`, and from plan step 0.1 onward the hub session that runs it
# is itself under this hook; denying it would break the one procedure that detects an
# account drift, while stopping no never-authorized act.

# does not recognise.  The alternative -- a bare `login|logout` denylist that matches the
# register literally -- fails OPEN on the next auth verb the CLI grows, and NA-3 is a
# fail-closed rule.  The cost of this reading is a false DENY on a future read-only verb,
# which is visible and one line to fix; the cost of the other is a silent ALLOW.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ NA-10
#
# O129 (hub extension) -- A LANE EDITING ITS OWN GATE.  This hook is re-read from disk on
# every tool call, and so is `.claude/settings.json`: an editing lane that rewrites either
# one is not making a change that takes effect at some later merge, it is making a change
# that takes effect on ITS NEXT TOOL CALL.  Nothing else in the register covered it -- NA-2
# guards `.claude-state/**` and `.claude/ANALYSIS_LOG.md`, NA-7 explicitly ALLOWS the lane's
# own worktree, and NA-6 is about tests -- so the three files that constitute the gate were
# the one part of the tree the gate did not defend.
#
# The predicate is (TAIL, VENUE) and nothing else.  UNDER ANY ROOT, because every lane
# worktree carries its own copy and it is that copy which governs that lane; and denied
# unless `--project-dir` equals the board root, because hook evolution stays hub-authored at
# the board venue, where the hub's own subagents run.  The board-venue ALLOW is not a
# loophole a lane can reach: the wrapper refuses `workdir-is-board-root`, so no lane is ever
# started there, and the argument is fixed by the registration a lane may no longer edit.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED READINGS (recorded, 0.05 fifth review delta):
#   * The shell arm scans BOTH the parsed write destinations AND -- whenever the command
#     exhibits any destructive act at all -- every token of the command.  A delete or a move
#     of the gate is as much "a lane editing its own gate" as a write is, and the register's
#     word is "any write" only because deleting your own hook is the same act with fewer
#     steps.  Over-scanning costs a visible DENY; under-scanning costs the gate.
#   * The LIMIT is unchanged and restated: an interpreter one-liner is invisible to a
#     text-matching hook.  The layers behind this rule are the wrapper's `hook-drifted` and
#     `hook-unregistered` refusals at dispatch and the sol review of every PR diff.
#
# NA-10 runs LAST, in register order.  Every specified row is attributable there: NA-7
# allows a lane's own worktree by construction, and none of the three tails is an NA-2
# protected path, so nothing else fires first and steals the reason line.
