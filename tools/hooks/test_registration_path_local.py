"""LOCAL registration-path gate for the MLV-App project PreToolUse hook.

WHY THIS FILE IS NOT UNDER ``tools/repo_hygiene/``.  The repo-hygiene job collects
``tools/repo_hygiene/test_*.py`` by discovery and runs it on ``windows-latest`` and
``ubuntu-latest``.  The command registered in ``.claude/settings.json`` names a PER-USER
ABSOLUTE INTERPRETER that exists on no hosted runner (O81), so a case that executes it
would be red in CI and green locally -- the exact split this repo already paid for.
Hosted CI therefore proves the RULES (``tools/repo_hygiene/test_mlv_never_authorized.py``);
this file proves the REGISTRATION, and the hub runs it on the branch and again after 0.1's
``.claude/settings.json`` conflict resolution.

    python -m unittest tools.hooks.test_registration_path_local -v

A hook is (interpreter x script x REGISTRATION).  Hashing the script proves only the middle
term; this file executes the registered command string VERBATIM -- the same string the
harness runs, with only ``${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`` expanded, exactly as the harness expands
it -- from a disposable worktree-like directory, and asserts exit 0 on a benign payload and
exit 2 on a harmless one.  ``py -3`` hooks on this machine silently never executed until
2026-08-09; a hook that has never run looks exactly like a hook that always passes.

O126 -- AND SINCE THE FIFTH DELTA THE REGISTRATION CARRIES THE VENUE.  The command string
now ends ``--project-dir "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"``, and three rules key on that argument
(NA-2 exception (iv), the S105 enable act, NA-10).  The previous revision read the
ENVIRONMENT variable of that name, which is absent from real hook processes, so the venue
test never fired.  This file is therefore the only place the ARGUMENT itself is proven to
travel: ``test_registered_command_carries_the_venue_argument`` sends an NA-10 payload whose
verdict is decided by nothing else, with the venue variable STRIPPED from the environment,
so a registration that lost the argument goes red here.
